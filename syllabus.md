## 2. Course Description and Learning Objectives
Programming for Cognitive Science has three primary learning objectives: 
- to learn what computer programming is, and what one can accomplish using computer programs
- to master the basics of how to write computer programs in the Python programming language, including its syntax and proper programming technique and style
- to discuss how computer programs, models, and simulations contribute to research about brain and cognitive science.


## 3. Course Requirements and Grading

### Grading Scale
A: 90-100
B: 80-90
C: 70-80
D: 60-70
F: Below 60
Except in rare exceptions, +/- grades are not given in this class.

### Grade Components
- Labs: 50%
- Homework: 30%
- Final Project: 20%

### Labs
Each week we will be spending a considerable portion of our lab time working on various lab
exercises. Each lab assignment is one of the final section's of each chapter in the textbook. Lab assignments should be turned in each week on the course website. Labs are due each week on Friday at 5pm. They can be turned in Monday by 5pm for a 20% deduction. After Monday at 5pm they will not be accepted unless you have made prior arrangements.

### Homework
There are six homework assignments throughout the semester, about every other week. The homework assignments involve creating a single more complex python program that achieves some BCOG-related goal. Homework assignments should be turned in each week on the course website. These homework assignments are due on a Monday at 5pm, and 10% is deducted for each day they are late.

### Final Project
The final project will involve creating a Python program that is more complex, like the homework assignments, but on a topic of your own choosing. We will discuss the details later. At the end of the semester, you will turn in your code and a brief project report, which describes your project. For the project, you may work alone or in a group. The bigger the group, the higher the expectations for your project.


## 4. Academic Integrity Policy
This class will take the University’s Academic Integrity policy very seriously. Cheating and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. The University of Illinois has the responsibility for maintaining academic integrity so as to protect the quality of education and research on our campus and to protect those who depend upon our integrity. It is the responsibility of each student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions. It is also a responsibility of the student to know and understand what constitutes academic integrity infractions. Ignorance is not a valid excuse. The University’s official statement of a student’s responsibilities can be found here: http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html. More information about the University’s academic integrity policy, and what constitutes an infraction, can be found here: http://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity/.


## 5. Accommodation Policy
To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, 
call 333-4603, e-mail disability@illinois.edu or go to the DRES website (https://www.disability.illinois.edu). If you are concerned you have a disability-related condition that is impacting your academic progress, there are academic screening appointments available on campus that can help diagnosis a previously undiagnosed disability by visiting the DRES website and selecting “Sign-Up for an Academic Screening” at the bottom of the page.”
