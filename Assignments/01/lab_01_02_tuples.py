# a "tuple" is like a list, except that it is "immutable", meaning it cannot be changed once it is created.

my_tuple = ("lion", "tiger", "bear", "elephant", "zebra", "hippo")
print(my_tuple)

# this code would generate an error, because you are not allowed to change a tuple
# my_tuple[1] = "mouse"

# of course, if you *really* need to change a tuple for some reason, you can convert it to a list
# my_list = list(my_tuple)
# my_list[1] = "mouse"
# my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
# print(my_tuple)

# other than that, you can do everything with a tuple that you can do with a list
# write some code below showing that the different things you learned to do for lists also works for tuples
