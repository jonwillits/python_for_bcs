# 3.7. Lab 3

For Lab 2
- Open your code editor and create a new file. 
- Save the file in your BCOG200 directory, and name it "lastname_firstname_lab3.py". 
- Copy the code below and paste the code into your lab3.py file, and save the file.
- Finally, follow the instructions in the code to complete Lab 3.
- Submit your lab using the course website.
- Make sure your code runs without errors or it will get a 0. If you have a particular question you can't fix
    just comment that part of the code out

"""
The reading says that a good principle of software design is to "make different pieces of code that do 
different things independent". Explain what this means and describe an example. Use a print statement to output your
answer.

Imagine I want to output the words in the list below to a file, one word per line. The code below does not succeed 
in doing that, for three reasons. Use a print statement to describe the three problems, and then fix the code so that 
it does what is intended.

print("\n########## Question 3 ##########\n")
"""
The reading described at least four different ways you can read in a file.
- read()
- readline()
- readlines()
- looping over a file
Describe a situation where you might want to use each one, and explain why that is a good choice for the situation.
Use a print statement to output your answer.

print("\n########## Question 4 ##########\n")
"""
Write code that creates a file called "skinner_quotes.txt" and writes each of these quotes to the file, one quote
per line.
"""
skinner_quotes = ["What is love except another name for positive reinforcement? Or vice versa.",
                  "If freedom is required for happiness, then what is necessary is to provide the illusion of freedom.",

print("\n########## Question 5 ##########\n")
"""
Write code that reads in the file you created in the previous question, and counts how many total words and how many 
unique words are in the file, and then outputs those numbers to the screen. Your answer should look like this (and 
these are the correct numbers):
Unique Words: 26
Total Words: 302

print("\n########## Question 6-10 ##########\n")
"""
6) Use Tkinter to Create a Window with the title "Runner", that is 800 pixels wide, 600 pixels tall, and that has a
    white background. Specify the size in a tuple named "screen_size", and use that tuple to control the size of the
    window.

7) Create two frames in the window, one called "action_frame" and one called "button_frame". Use .grid() to position the 
button frame at the bottom. Make the button frame 100 pixels tall, and the action frame the remainder (700). But code 
this in a way such that if we change the overall window height to 1200 pixels or 600 pixels, the action frame remains 
the correct height (1100 or 500, respectively).

8) Create a "Quit" button that terminates the application, and a "Go!" button (whose action we will implement later). 
Change the appearance of the buttons (size, shape, color, etc.) and arrange these buttons in the button frame in a manner 
of your choosing.

9) Create a canvas called action_canvas in the action_frame that occupies the entirety of the frame. Centered and at 
the top of the canvas, add some text that says "Here is a runner. Click the 'Go!' button to make them run." Change 
the font size, type, and color to a choice of your liking. save the image at the bottom, and then add it to the canvas 
centered and below the text.

10) create a function called "start_runner" that is activated by pressing the "Go!" button. Make the image move 500 
times, each time by 10 pixels. But, if the runner gets to either edge of the screen, have the image start moving in
the other direction.
