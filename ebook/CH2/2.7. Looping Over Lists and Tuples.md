# 2.7. Looping Over Lists

Looping over lists and tuples works the same way it does for strings or any other sequence or iterator. You can use
the loop to get each item, one at a time; you can use a range() object to get a sequence of index values the length of
the list; or you can use enumerate() to do both.

```python
some_list = ["lions", "tigers", "bears", "oh my!"]

for some_item in some_list:
    new_item = some_item.upper()
    print(new_item)

for i in range(len(some_list)):
    print(i, some_list[i])

for i, some_item in enumerate(some_list):
    new_item = some_item.upper()
    some_list[i] = new_item
    print("Changed {} to {}".format(some_item, new_item))

```

The above code outputs:
```text 
LIONS
TIGERS
BEARS
OH MY!

0 lions
1 tigers
2 bears
3 oh my!

Changed lions to LIONS
Changed tigers to TIGERS
Changed bears to BEARS
Changed oh my! to OH MY!
```

One of the main situations where using the index comes in handy is when you have two lists that are the same length, 
and you want to iterate over them at the same time:
```python
pre_test_score_list = [92, 88, 77, 65, 92]
post_test_score_list = [96, 94, 74, 77, 95]

improvement_list = []

if len(pre_test_score_list) == len(post_test_score_list):
    for i in range(len(pre_test_score_list)):
        improvement = post_test_score_list[i] - pre_test_score_list[i]
        improvement_list.append(improvement)

average_improvement = sum(improvement_list) / len(improvement_list)
print("The average improvement was {:0.2f}".format(average_improvement))
```
