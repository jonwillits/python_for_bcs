# 2.4. Lists

We have mentioned lists a few times, now its time to go over them in detail. In python, a list is another sequence data
type, like strings and range() objects. Like strings and range() objects, they have an order to the sequence. However,
lists are special in a number of ways, the most important being that you can put any other python data type inside a
a list. Lists in python are declared with square brackets, and then with commas separating the list elements.

```python
list1 = ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse']  # a list of strings
list2 = [1, 5, 23, 32]  # a list of ints
list3 = [42.2, 21.0, 82.2321, 254.21]  # a list of floats
list4 = [True, False, False, True]
list5 = ['dog', 23, 'pizza', 45.0, None, True, list3]  # a list mixing data types

print(list1)  # prints all of list1

```

Lists in python can mix different data types, as you can see in *list5*. You can even put lists inside of other lists!

## List Indexing and Slicing

Lists are ordered, and each element of the string can be accessed the same way as strings, by using brackets and a 
number to retrieve a single item from the list]. Lists can also be sliced just like a string. If you have a list 
inside of a list like in list5, and you want to access a member of the inner list, you use two sets of square brackets:

```python
x = list3[2]  # stores the 3rd element of list3 (82.2321) in x
x = list1[-1] # stored the last element of list1 ('mouse') in x
x = list2[1:] # stores everything from element 2 to the end of list 1 (['cat', 'mouse']) in x
x = list5[5][1] # stores 21.0 in x, because list3 is the 6th element of list5, and 21.0 is the 2nd element of list3
```

## Lists are Mutable

One big difference between lists and strings is that you can modify part of a list, but not part of a string. Strings
are what are called *immutable" objects. You can change a whole list, but not part of it.

```python
x = "pizza"
y = "sandwich"
x[4] = "A"  # this line would generate an error; strings are immutable and their parts cannot be changed
x = "broccoli"  # isn't changing the string that was in x, actually replacing it entirely
x = x + y  # appends sandwich to broccoli, but isn't changing a part, is again wholly replacing what is stored in x

list1 = ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse']
list1[2] = 'rat'  # this is allowed, because unlike strings, lists are mutable objects
list1[1] = 5.5  # python doesn't care what kind of object was in a list position, you can replace it with another type
list1[2] = "dog"  # python lists are also allowed to have duplicates.
```


## Searching for List Elements
Some of the other commands we learned with strings work with lists too.
```python
list1 = ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse']

search_token = 'dog'
if search_token in list:
    print("Found {}!".format(search_token))
else:
    print("Didn't find {}!".format(search_token))

search_token = 'o'
if search_token in list:
    print("Found {}!".format(search_token))
else:
    print("Didn't find {}!".format(search_token))
```

The "if x in y" command works for searching for something in a list, just like it did in a string. But note that in the
first example, the if statement would be True (dog is in the list). But the second if statement would be False. There 
is an 'o' in the list (two, in fact). But when you search for something in a list, it searches for a match for with 
each entire element of the sequence, not all the sub-elements of the sequence.

There is something else important to point out in the example above. Note that we used a variable to designate what we
wanted to search for. We could have "hard-coded" dog in the first example:

```python
if 'dog' in list1:
    print("Found dog!")
else:
    print("Didn't find dog!")

if 'o' in list1:
    print("Found o!")
else:
    print("Didn't find o!")
```

But if we had done it that way, we would have had to change three things if we wanted to change what we were searching
for: the if statement itself, and both print statements. But because we used a variable, we didn't have to change any of
the code at all, except for whatever was saved in the search_token variable. One important thing to learn in programming
is to make use of variables whenever possible, as it will make your code much more re-usable later.

## Passing Lists to Built-in Python Functions

Just like strings, lists can be passed to many built-in functions.

```python
list1 = [1, 65, 23, 77, 23]

list_length = len(list1)  # stores the length of the list (5)
list_sum = sum(list1)  # stores the sum of the list (189)
list_max = max(list1)  # returns the max value in the list (77)
list_min = min(list1)  # returns the min value in the list (1)

```

## Passing Iterators to List()

In addition to declaring a list the way we described in the last section, you can also create a list using the list()
function. The list function requires you to pass it an iterator object, like a range() object:
```python
list1 = list(range(5))  # creates the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Another useful function that creates an iterator object is reversed(). The reversed() function can be passed any ordered
sequence and it will return you back an iterator object of the items in the reversed order. Note that if you print this
out, you don't see the sequence in reverse, you just see the iterator object.
```python
list1 = [1, 65, 23, 77, 23]
print(reversed(list1))
```
```text
<reversed object at 0x10f1e9840>
```

But you can pass the reversed iterator object into the list() function, to convert it into a list.

```python
list2 = list(reversed(list1))  # stores [32, 77, 23, 65, 1] in list2
```
