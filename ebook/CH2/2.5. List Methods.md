# 2.5. List Methods

## List Methods

Like the other data types (str, int, float, etc.), lists are an object, which means they have functions (called methods)
that are a built in part of the list, and that you can call using the .method_name() procedure. For example:

```python
list1 = [1, 65, 23, 77, 23]

list1.append(31)  # adds a single item to the end of a list: list1 = list2 = [1, 65, 23, 77, 23, 31]

list1.clear()  # removes all items from a list, resulting in an empty list: list1 = []

list2 = list1.copy()  # creates a copy of the list: list2 = [1, 65, 23, 77, 23]

x = list1.count(23)  #  tells you how many times a particular element occurs in a list: x = 2

list2 = ['dog', 'cat']
list1.extend(list2) # concatenates a list onto the end of a list: list1 = [1, 65, 34, 23, 77, 23, 'dog', 'cat']

x = list1.index(23)  # tells you the first index where the element is found: x = 2. will cause error if not in list

list1.insert(2, 34)  #  inserts a 34 in the 3rd position, moving others back: list1 = [1, 65, 34, 23, 77, 23]

x = list1.pop(3)  # removes element at specified position: x = 77, list1 = [1, 65, 23, 23].
x = list1.pop()  # default for pop if not specified is -1, the last element in the list

list1.remove(23)  # removes the first occurrence of the specified value from the list: list1 = [1, 65, 77, 23]

list1.reverse()  # reversed the order of the list: list1 = [23, 77, 23, 65, 1]

list1.sort()  #  sorts the list. list1 = [1, 23, 23, 65, 77]
list1.sort(reverse=True)  # sorts a list in largest to smallest order

list1 = [1, 6, 3, "dog", "cat"]
list1.sort()  #  this line will get an error; you can't sort a list that mixes different types of data
```

## List Copying: Python List Assignments are Copies By Reference!

You may have noticed that one of the methods for list is copy(). Why is this necessary? Can't we make a copy by doing 
the following?
```python
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = list1
```

That works for strings, ints, floats, and booleans. Remember how we introduced the idea of copying by reference vs. 
copying by value? Copying by value means creating a copy of the value stored in the variable, and assigning it to the 
new variable. That's what happens for stings, ints, floats, and booleans. But lists are different, they copy by 
reference. So in the example above, what happens is that the variable list2 is actually 'pointing to' the exact same 
variable as as list1.

What does this mean and why does it matter? Consider the following code:
```python
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = list1

list2[0] = -1
list1[-1] = -1

print(list1)
print(list2)
```

the output here is:
```text
[-1, 2, 3, 4, -1]
[-1, 2, 3, 4, -1]
```

Notice that both lists are the same! When list2 is created and set equal to list1, you can think of that as two 
different variables pointing to the same data. So a command using either name to change its data changes the underlying
data for both.

This is where .copy() method is useful. If you actually want to create a copy so that you can change one without changing the
other, you have to use .copy().

```python
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = list1.copy()

list2[0] = -1
list1[-1] = -1

print(list1)
print(list2)
```

Which results in:
```text
[1, 2, 3, 4, -1]
[-1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The .copy() method for a list creates what is called a *shallow* copy. This means that the top level variable (the list)
itself is copied. It is then filled with all the same variables that were in the list. So if these are integers like
in the example above, you get a pure copy. However, if one of the items in the list is another list, then you still only
get a reference to that list in the new list.

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list3 = [list1, list2]

list4 = list3.copy()
list3[0] = "apple"
list2[0] = "A"

print(list3)
print(list4)

```

Which results in:
```text
['apple', ['A', 'b', 'c']]
[[1, 2, 3], ['A', 'b', 'c']]
```

The string 'apple' replaces the first element in list3 just like we specified, and it does not replace the first element
in list4, because list4 was a copy, and so all of its top level  ditems were copied. The reference to list1 in list3 and
list4 were independent, so replacing one with "apple" doesn't change the other. But the references to list1 and list2 
inside lists 3 and 4 point to the same object, and so if you make a change to one of those objects, you see it reflected
in both.

If you want to copy everything in a list so you can change everything inside of it, you need to use a function called
deepcopy().

```python
import copy
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list3 = [list1, list2]
list4 = copy.deepcopy(list3)
``` d
