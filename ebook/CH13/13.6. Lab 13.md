# 13.6. Lab 13

Lab 13 is easy. Follow the instructions in this chapter to create the experiment, and run it. Once you are 
sure all the code works as intended, then you are going to take the experiment for real, trying as hard as you can.
You will turn in your .csv data file as your lab assignment.


While working on getting the code running, we had the number of familiarization and test trials set to 4.
But for your actual participation in the experiment, we want there to be 30 familiarization and test trials.
So before you take the experiment for real, make sure the following three lines in your config.py file are as follows:
```python
condition = 1
num_familiarization_trials = 30
num_test_trials = 30
```

 Once you have finished, submit your data (the CSV file with your experimental data) as your lab. 
 The file should look like this:
```csv
participant_id,stimulus_type,trial_number,stimulus,old_or_new,response,correct,rt
20230630135309211149_458316,images,1,raspberry,new,new,1,0.6479840278625488
20230630135309211149_458316,images,2,wrench,new,new,1,0.8111679553985596

20230630135309211149_458316,images,4,potato,old,old,1,0.25566625595092773
```
Except that your file should have 31 rows (1 header and data from 30 test trials).
