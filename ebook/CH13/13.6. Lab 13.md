# 13.6. Lab 13

Lab 13 is easy. Get the code from this chapter running, and then take the experiment yourself. Submit 
your data (the CSV file with your experimental data) as your lab. The file should look like this:
```csv
participant_id,stimulus_type,trial_number,stimulus,old_or_new,response,correct,rt
20230630135309211149_458316,images,1,raspberry,new,new,1,0.6479840278625488
20230630135309211149_458316,images,2,wrench,new,new,1,0.8111679553985596
20230630135309211149_458316,images,3,swan,old,old,1,0.3151421546936035
20230630135309211149_458316,images,4,potato,old,old,1,0.25566625595092773
```
Except that your file should have 31 rows (1 header and data from 30 trials). Before you run the 
experiment, make sure your config file's "condition" variable is set to 1, so that when you take 
the experiment it shows you images.
