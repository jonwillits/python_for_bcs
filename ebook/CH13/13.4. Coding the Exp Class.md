# 13.4. Coding the Exp Class

### Creating an empty GUI class
We are now ready to create our Exp class. But one thing we want to be able to do is test it as we go. And you may 
remember that the Exp class we call in the run_experiment.py script is passed an instance of the GUI class. So in order 
to be able to make it work, we need to create that first, even though it makes sense to explain it later. So let's start 
by just creating an empty GUI class. Open the gui.py file, and insert the following code:
```python
class GUI:

    def __init__(self):
        pass
```
This code will allow us to run the run_experiment.py script without getting an error, testing it as we go. We can then 
go in and fill in the details of this class in the next section. After adding this, make sure to save your changes to 
the file.

### The Exp class's `__init__` method
Remember that classes need an `__init__()` method if you are going to create instances of it. So open the exp.py file

```python
import csv
import os
import random
import datetime
from config.config import Config

class Exp:

    def __init__(self, the_gui):
        self.the_gui = the_gui

        self.participant_id = None

        self.instruction_list = None
        self.full_stimulus_list = None
        self.familiarization_list = None
        self.test_list = None
  
        self.data_list = []
```
