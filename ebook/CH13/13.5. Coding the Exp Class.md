# 13.5. Coding the Exp Class

### The Exp class's `__init__` method
Now let's begin coding our Exp class. We will start with the class's `__init__` method. Open 
your `exp.py` file and add the following code:
```python
import csv
import os
import random
import datetime
from config.config import Config

class Exp:

    def __init__(self, the_gui):
        self.the_gui = the_gui  # an instance of the Gui class, which we will use to present info to the screen

        self.participant_id = None  # a unique number for each participant that we will create

        self.instruction_list = None  # a list of strings containing the data in the instruction file
        self.full_stimulus_list = None  # a list of all the possible words/images for the experiment
        self.familiarization_list = None  # the list of words in this participant's familiarization phase
        self.test_list = None  # the list of words in this participant's test list
  
        self.data_list = []  # a list that will keep track of the data for each trial in the experiment

        self.create_participant_id()  # a method that will generate a id number of the participant
        self.create_instruction_list()  # a method that will load the data from the instructions text file
        self.create_stimuli_lists()  # a method that will create the list of possible stimuli from the image folder
        self.run_experiment()  # a method that will run the actual experiment
```
At the top of the file, we import all the libraries we are going to use. This includes our config.py library, which we 
import using slightly different syntax, telling it where that file of our is located (inside the config.py file, which 
is inside the config folder).

Then we define our Exp Class. In its `__init__` method, we define all the attributes that the class will have. We 
also define the methods that we want to execute when an instance of the class is created. In this case there will 
be the four methods listed above.

### The `create_participant_id()` method
Next we want a function that creates an id number for each participant. We need this so that we can store each 
participant's data without getting the data from each participant mixed up. But we also want to do that in an 
anonymous way. So what we will do is use the datetime module to get the current date and time (down to the microsecond), 
and use the random module to generate a random number, and put these together. This means that the probability of 
two different people running this program on different computers generating two identical id numbers would be very low.
```python
    def create_participant_id(self):
        current_datetime = datetime.datetime.now()  # gets the current date at time as a datetime object
        formatted_datetime = current_datetime.strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S%f")  # converts the datetime object to a string
        random_number = random.randint(100000, 999999)  # choose a random 6 digit number
        self.participant_id = f"{formatted_datetime}_{random_number}"  # save combination as the participant id
```

### The `create_instruction_list()` method
Next we want to implement the method that loads the instructions and saves them in a list, with each line from the 
file as a separate item in the list.
```python
    def create_instruction_list(self):
        self.instruction_list = []  # create the empty list
        current_condition = Config.condition # get the current condition (word or image) from the config file
        instruction_filename = Config.instruction_file_path_list[current_condition]  # get file path from config file

        with open(instruction_filename, 'r') as file:  # open the instruction file in read mode
            for line in file:  # for each line in the file
                line = line.strip('\n')  # strip off the newlines from each line in the file
                line = line.replace(".", ".\n")  # replace every period in the current line with a period followed by \n
                self.instruction_list.append(line) # add the string to the instruction list
```
You may wonder, why are we removing the newlines after each line in the file, and then adding newlines back after every 
period? Remember that each line in the file corresponds to instructions that we want to show up at a different time in 
the experiment, so in the file, newlines convey that information. Those are the newlines we are removing, because we 
don't actually want to print those to the screen. But then we do want newlines to separate each sentence on the screen,
(that will look nicer), so we are adding newlines in after every period.

### The `create_stimuli_lists()` method and its sub-methods
Next we want a method that will generate our stimulus lists from the directory of images. For this we want to create 
three lists:
1) a full stimulus list, containing all the possible stimuli for the experiment
2) a familiarization list, containing a specified number of randomly selected items from the full stimulus list
3) a test list, containing a specified number of items, half of which are random selections from the familiarization
list

Below is the `create_stimuli_lists()` method. As you can see, in this method, we are just going to call three other 
methods, for the three parts of this mentioned above. We finish by randomizing the order of both lists.
```python
    def create_stimuli_lists(self):
        self.create_full_stimulus_list()  # call a function to create the full stimulus list
        self.create_familiarization_list() # call a function to create the full stimulus list
        self.create_test_list() # call a function to create the full stimulus list
        random.shuffle(self.create_familiarization_list) # randomize the order of the stimuli
        random.shuffle(self.test_list) # randomize the order of the stimuli
```
This may seem like extra work, creating a function that just calls the other functions. Couldn't we just put the code from those three functions
in this function? We could, but remember a principle of good programming is to keep your code well organized, easily 
readable, and modular. But breaking each one up, it is really clear where to look if we need to fix mistakes or if 
we want to change the behavior of the code later. Also, keeping code modular means we could call each of these 
sub-functions from somewhere else in the code if we wanted to, and run them independently. If the code were all in 
one function, we wouldn't be able to do that.

So now we will create those three sub-functions. In the `create_full_stimulus_list()` method, we want to load the 
list of images in the images/ directory, and create a list out of the names of the files (after stripping off the 
file ending and removing hidden files).
```python
    def create_full_stimulus_list(self):
        directory_list = os.listdir('stimuli/images/')  # get a list of all the files in the images directory
        self.full_stimulus_list = []  # create the empy stimulus list
        for thing in directory_list:  # loop through the list of files in the images directory
            if not thing.startswith("."):  # if the current item is not a hidden file (hidden files start with ".")
                self.full_stimulus_list.append(thing[:-4])  # append its name to the stimulus list, minus the file ending

        # if this experiment uses images, call the Gui's preload images method, passing it the list of stimulus names
        if Config.condition == 1:  
            self.the_gui.preload_images(self.full_stimulus_list) 
```
In the `create_familiarization_list()` method, we want to select a random number of those stimuli, using the number
specified in the Config file. We start off randomly shuffling the list, because we want to make sure we don't always 
select the same stimuli each time we run the experiment.
```python
    def create_familiarization_list(self):
        random.shuffle(self.full_stimulus_list) # randomize the stimulus list
        
        # select teh first num_familiarization_trials items from the randomized list
        self.familiarization_list = self.full_stimulus_list[:Config.num_familiarization_trials]
```

In the `create_test_list()` method, we want to select a specified number of items (specified in the Config file), half 
of which come from the familiarization list, and half which do not. We achieve this in the following way. Remmeber that 
when we chose the items for the familiarization list, we chose the first `num_familiarization_trials` from our 
full stimulus list. So we will use half of those. To choose the new items, we can just pick up right where we left off,
and continue taking more items from the randomized full stimulus list. We want to get the next "num_test_trials/2" items 
from the list, because we want half of our stimuli to be new items.

```python
    def create_test_list(self):

        # determine how many test trials should come from the familiarization list
        num_old_test_trials = Config.num_test_trials//2

        # get half of our test items from the familiarization list.
        # this is why we have to remember to shuffle the order of our familiarization and test lists in the 
        # create_stimuli_lists() method, since we don't want the participant to experience the first half of the test 
        # list as old items, or the first half of the familiarization list as test items        
        self.test_list = self.familiarization_list[:num_old_test_trials]
        
        # to get our new items, we need to create an index corresponding to the num of fam trials, where we left off 
        # when we took items from the full stimulus list when we generated the familiarization list
        start = Config.num_familiarization_trials  
        
        # the position in the full stimulus list where we will stop drawing new stimuli for the test list
        stop = start + Config.num_test_trials//2
        
        # get the rest of our test list using those two indexes
        self.test_list += self.full_stimulus_list[start:stop]
```

### The `run_experiment()` method
Finally, we are ready for our `run_experiment` method. This method will just define the structure of our experiment.
Recall that our experiment will have the following structure:
- show our beginning instructions
- present the familiarization list
- show the test instructions
- present the test list
- show the final instructions

Every time we want to show some instructions, we can just call the gui.show_instructions() method that already made.
We just need to pass it the correct index in the list. So each time we call it, we pass it the instruction list with a 
different index.

For the presentation of our stimuli, we will create one additional method `present_stimulus_list()`. We will define this 
method in just a minute. If done right, we can re-use this method for both our familiarization and test phases. We will 
pass this method the list of stimuli we want to use, a list of keys that, when pressed, end the current trial and 
remove that stimulus, and a boolean variable that specifies whether we want to record the data for that trial or not. 
We will set this to True for the test phase and False for the Familiarization phase (because participants don't have 
to press any keys in that phase).

This method will also call a method we will use at the very end of the experiment, to save the data to a file. We will 
define this method below.

Finally, we conclude `run_experiment()` by closing **the Gui window.**
```python
    def run_experiment(self):
        self.the_gui.show_instructions(self.instruction_list[0], True)
        self.present_stimulus_list(self.familiarization_list, Config.familiarization_key_list, False)
        self.the_gui.show_instructions(self.instruction_list[1], False, Config.test_delay)
        self.the_gui.show_instructions(self.instruction_list[2], False)
        self.the_gui.show_instructions(self.instruction_list[3], False)
        self.the_gui.show_instructions(self.instruction_list[4], False)
        self.present_stimulus_list(self.test_list, Config.test_key_list, True)
        self.the_gui.show_instructions(self.instruction_list[5], True)
        self.save_data()
        self.the_gui.root.destroy()
```

### The `present_stimulus_list()` method
The `present_stimulus_list()` method is pretty simple. We just loop through our stimulus list, and call the 
`gui.show_stimulus()` method that we have already defined. We pass it the name of the current stimulus, and the list
of keys that end the trial (or `None`, in which case the stimulus will be presented for a fixed amount of time). 
Remember that we got this info from the Config file and put in as the input argument when the method was called.

The `gui.show_stimulus()` method returns us the key that was pressed, and the amount of time it took for the key 
to be pressed. If we want to save this data (also a value we passed in, True in the Test phase and False in the 
Familiarization phase), we will create a list out of the name of the stimulus, the key that was pressed, and the 
reaction time, and append that list to self.data_list, our variable for storing the data for all trials.

```python
    def present_stimulus_list(self, stimulus_list, key_list, record_data):
        for stimulus_name in stimulus_list:
            key_pressed, rt = self.the_gui.show_stimulus(stimulus_name, key_list)
            if record_data:
                trial_data = [stimulus_name, key_pressed, rt]
                self.data_list.append(trial_data)
```

### The `save_data()` method
We are almost done. The last thing we need to do is save the data. The `save_data()` method needs to do a few things. At 
this point, our `self.data_list` variable is a list of lists, with each element in the list containing the data for a 
single trial. It has:
- the trial_number
- the stimulus name
- the key that was pressed
- the reaction time

We want to add a few more pieces of info to each trial:
- the participant id
- the condition (words vs. images)
- whether the key that was pressed was the correct key.

We also want to add a list at the very beginning of the list of lists, with a header specifying what information is in 
each list element.

```python
    def save_data(self):
        final_data_list = [] # an empty list where we will put the combined data we aleady had plus the new data
        
        # insert a new list into our data_list, a list of strings specified what data is stored in each list element
        final_data_list.append(["participant_id", 
                                "stimulus_type", 
                                "trial_number", 
                                "stimulus", 
                                "old_or_new", 
                                "response", 
                                "correct", 
                                "rt"])
       
        # now we need to go through each trial, and create a list with those 8 items listed above
        for i, trial_data in enumerate(self.data_list):  # for each trial in self.data_list
            
            final_trial_data = [] # create a new empty list for this trial
            
            # add the participant id to the trial
            final_trial_data.append(self.participant_id)  
            
            # add "words" or "images" to this trial, depending on the value in the Config file specifying the condition
            if Config.condition == 0:
                final_trial_data.append("words")
            else:
                final_trial_data.append("images")
            
            # add the trial number to the trial data, starting count at 1 instead of 0
            final_trial_data.append(i+1)

            # add the current stimulus name to the trial data
            final_trial_data.append(trial_data[0])
            
            # add "old" or "new" depending on whether this test item was in the familiarization list
            if trial_data[0] in self.familiarization_list:
                old_or_new = "old"
            else:
                old_or_new = "new"
            final_trial_data.append(old_or_new)
            
            # add the key that was pressed
            final_trial_data.append(trial_data[1])
            
            # add whether the key that was pressed was the correct key
            if old_or_new == "old":
                if trial_data[1] == "j":
                    correct = 1
                else:
                    correct = 0
            else:
                if trial_data[1] == "k":
                    correct = 1
                else:
                    correct = 0
            final_trial_data.append(correct)

            # add the reaction time to the trial data
            final_trial_data.append(trial_data[2])
        
            # add the data for the current trial to the full final data list
            final_data_list.append(final_trial_data)

        # create a file with the participant's id number as the file_name, ending with .csv
        filename = f'data/{self.participant_id}.csv'

        # use the csv module to write the full list of lists to the file
        with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            writer.writerows(self.data_list)
```
