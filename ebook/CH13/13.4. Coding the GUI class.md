# 13.4. Coding the Gui Class

First we are going to create our Gui Class. This class is going to create the window in which the experiment will be 
displayed, and have different functions for presenting different kinds of stimuli and recording different kinds of data.

We will implement this window using tkinter, which you probably learned about in CH11. If not, do not worry, you should 
be able to get by without it here. The only thing you really need to know about tkinter for now is that it is a python 
module that allows you to create graphical user interfaces (GUI's). The main entities in tkinter are windows and 
"widgets", which are interactive objects you can put inside windows. In this program, we only need one kind of widget, 
a "label" widget. A label widget can be placed inside a window, and can be used to display text or images.

### The `__init__() method`
Let's start with our import statements and our `__init__` method. At the top of the file, we import all the libraries 
we are going to use. This includes our config.py library, which we import using slightly different syntax, telling it 
where that file of our is located (inside the config.py file, which is inside the config folder). One of these modules,
the PIL module, is likely new, and you will need to install it using `pip3 install PIL` in your terminal.

Next we define our Gui Class. In its `__init__` method, we define all the attributes that the class will have. We 
also define the methods that we want to execute when an instance of the class is created. In this case there will 
be two methods, one to create the window, and one to create the tk label widgets that we will use to present text or 
images.
```python
import tkinter as tk
import time
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
from config.config import Config

class Gui:

    def __init__(self):
        pass
        self.root = None  # the variable where we will store the main window
        self.stimulus_label = None  #  a tkinter label widget that we will use to present text or images
        self.instructions_label = None  #  a tkinter label widget that we will use to present instructions
        self.key_pressed = None  # variable we will use to keep track of which key has been pressed
        self.image_dict = None  # a dictionary of image names pointing to tk image objects

        self.create_window()
        self.create_labels()
```

### The `create_window() method`
Next we will create our method that creates the experiment window. We set a variety of the window's properties using 
values stored in the config file.
```python
    def create_window(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()  # create the tk window object and save it in self.root
        self.root.geometry("{}x{}".format(Config.window_width, Config.window_height))  # set the window size
        self.root.title("Experiment")  # set the window title
        self.root.configure(bg="white")  # set the window background color
        self.root.resizable(False, False)  # set the window so that it is not resizable
```

### The `create_labels() method`
Next we will create our method that creates the tk label widgets. As with the main window, we set a variety of the 
properties using values stored in the Config file.
```python
    def create_labels(self):
        self.instructions_text_label = tk.Label(self.root, anchor='center',
                                                height=Config.window_height,
                                                width=Config.window_width,
                                                bg=Config.instructions_bg_color,
                                                fg=Config.instructions_font_color,
                                                font="{} {}".format(Config.instructions_font,
                                                                    Config.instructions_font_size))

        self.stimulus_label = tk.Label(self.root, anchor='center',
                                       height=Config.window_height,
                                       width=Config.window_width,
                                       bg=Config.stimulus_bg_color,
                                       fg=Config.stimulus_font_color,
                                       font="{} {}".format(Config.stimulus_font,
                                                           Config.stimulus_font_size))
```

### The `preload_images() method`
Next we need a method that loads all the images. It is very important to load them all now, instead of loading them 
each time we want to present one to the screen. This is because it takes a bit of time to load an image, and we
would rather have that time transpire all at once at the beginning. This method will be passed a list of names of images,
and we will hardcode the location of the saved images since we plan on them always being in the same place. If you wanted
to make this more flexible, you could save the image location in the config file. 
```python
        
    def preload_images(self, image_name_list):
        self.image_dict = {}  # create an empty dictionary to store the images
        for image_name in image_name_list:  # for each image name in the image name list
            image = Image.open("stimuli/images/" + image_name + ".jpg") # create a PIL image object for that image name
            photo_image = ImageTk.PhotoImage(image)  # convert the PIL image object into a TK image object
            self.image_dict[image_name] = photo_image  # save the image in the dictionary with its name as a the key
```
You may notice that this method did not get called from inside the class's init method. That is because we don't want 
this method to execute immediately when we create an instance of the GUI class. If you remember back to our 
`run_experiment.py` script, at the moment we create the GUI class, we haven't yet created the Exp class. But the Exp 
is the class that contains the list of image names. So we will create the method here, but then call it from inside 
the Exp class after we have created our list of image names.

Another detail here is we are using the PIL library. This is because TK is limited in terms of the kinds of image file 
types it allows. It only allows .gif files. PIL is a python module for using, manipulating, and converting between 
different file types. We can load an image of many different file types into a PIL object, and tk allows us to convert 
that into a tk image object.

### The `show_instructions() method`
This method we will call from inside our Exp class anytime we want to show some instructions to the screen. We will 
make this method have three parameters:
1) a string containing the text we want to display
2) what key we want to use to end the display of instructions and remove them from the screen
3) whether we want to build in an extra pause before the instruction disappear

```python
    def show_instructions(self, instructions, end_on_key_press, extra_delay=None):
        self.instructions_text_label.configure(text=instructions)  # set the text property of the label to the instruction string
        self.instructions_text_label.pack() # make the label appear in the window
        self.instructions_text_label.pack_propagate(False) # prevent the label from changing size to fit the text
        self.root.update()  # force the window to update its graphics and reflect the changes that were made

        if end_on_key_press:  # if we want to end the instructions after a key has been pressed
            self.key_pressed = None  # set our variable reflecting whether a key has been pressed to False
            
            # create a tkinter event that activates whenever a key has been pressed
            # when a key has been pressed it calls the specified function check_for_valid_key_press()
            # we pass that function a list of key names that we are considering to be "valid" keys to press to end the 
            #    instructions. When a valid key is pressed, that function will set self.key pressed to that key
            self.root.bind('<Key>', lambda event: self.check_for_valid_key_press(event, ["space"]))
            
            # create a loop that runs while self.key_pressed is False
            # since we set key_pressed to None, which evaluates to False, the loop will run until key_pressed is set 
            # to something other than "None" by the self.check_for_valid_key_press() method
            while not self.key_pressed:  
                self.root.update()
                
        else: # if we do not want to end on a key press
            self.root.after(Config.instruction_delay) # sit and do nothing for the amount of time specied in the config file

        # sit and do nothing for an additional amount of time, if specified by extra_delay
        if extra_delay is not None:
            self.root.after(extra_delay)
            
        self.instructions_text_label.pack_forget() # remove the instruction_text_label from the window
```

### The `check_for_valid_key_press() method`

In this function we use the value of the event variable that was created to keep track of key presses. The event 
variable is a special tkinter object for keeping track of many different variables relating to events. In the case of 
a key event like we created, one of the things it will tell us is what key was pressed, stored in event.keysym.

```python
    def check_for_valid_key_press(self, event, valid_keys):
        if event.keysym in valid_keys: # check to see if the key that was pressed is one of the valid keys
            
            # gets rid of the event checking for key presses, meaning we only will get an event after the first key press
            self.root.unbind('<Key>')  
            
            # makes sure the main window is the active window in the program after the key press
            # this is just there as a precaution in case the key press did something unexpected
            self.root.focus_set() 
            
            self.key_pressed = event.keysym  # set our variable keeping track of what key was pressed to the current value
```


### The `show_stimulus() method`

The final method in our Gui class is the method we will use to show our text or image stimuli to the screen. The method 
is passed the current stimulus name, and also a key_list telling us the valid keys to trigger the end of the display of 
the stimulus. If key_list is None, then the stimulus will stay on the screen for a fixed amount of time.

```python
    def show_stimulus(self, stimulus_name, key_list):
        if Config.condition == 0: # if we are in the word condition
            self.stimulus_label.configure(text=stimulus_name)  # change the text to the current stimulus name
        elif Config.condition == 1:  # elif we are in the iamge condition
            stimulus_image = self.image_dict[stimulus_name]  # retrive the image from the image dict
            # set the label to the current image. This requires both lines below.
            self.stimulus_label.configure(image=stimulus_image) 
            self.stimulus_label.image = stimulus_image

        self.stimulus_label.pack()  # show the stimulus label in the window
        self.stimulus_label.pack_propagate(False)  # prevent the label from changing size to fit the image or text
        self.root.update()  # force the window to update and show whatever changes we have made
        time1 = time.time()  # get the current system time, reflecting the exact moment the stimulus went on screen

        if key_list is not None:
            self.key_pressed = None  # set key_pressed back to None
            
            # just like before, create a tkinter event that activates whenever a key has been pressed
            # when a key has been pressed it calls the specified function check_for_valid_key_press()
            # we pass that function a list of key names that we are considering to be "valid" keys to press to end the 
            # sitmulus presentation. When a valid key is pressed, that function will set self.key pressed to that key
            self.root.bind('<Key>', lambda event: self.check_for_valid_key_press(event, key_list))
            
            # create a loop that runs while self.key_pressed is False
            # since we set key_pressed to None, which evaluates to False, the loop will run until key_pressed is set 
            # to something other than "None" by the self.check_for_valid_key_press() method
            while not self.key_pressed:  # loop until self.key_pressed is not None
                self.root.update()
        
        else: # if key_list is set to None, then sit and do nothing for the specified amount of time
            self.root.after(Config.stimulus_presentation_time)
            
        time2 = time.time() # get the exact system time
        # compute the time different between when the stimulus was presented and the end of the stimulus, which will 
        # correspond to how long it took the participant to respond in the trials where a key must be pressed
        took = time2 - time1  
        
        self.stimulus_label.pack_forget()  # remove the stimulus from the screen
        
        # do nothing for the amount of time we want to delay between stimuli, specied in the Config file
        self.root.after(Config.inter_trial_interval) 

        return self.key_pressed, took  # return the key that was pressed and how it took
```
