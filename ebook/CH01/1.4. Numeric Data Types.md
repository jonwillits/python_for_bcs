# 1.4 Numeric Data Types

Python has three basic number data types: int, float, and complex.

## The *int* Data Type

An int is a whole number, positive or negative, of unlimited length.
```python
x = 3
y = 23125123415431534234546
z = -1
```


## The *float* Data Type

A "floating point number" is a positive or negative number containing one or more decimals. They can also be scientific 
notation.
```python
x = 3.1415
y = -41.21367544352
z = 8.2e10
```

There are a few useful methods you can use with floats.
```python
a = 4.5
b = a.as_integer_ratio()  # results in b = (9, 2)

a = 5.5
b = a.is_integer()   # return False, because a is not an integer
```


## The *complex* Data Type

Complex numbers are numbers that use j to express the imaginary part.
```python
x =Â 8+2j  
y = 2j  
z = -2j
```
