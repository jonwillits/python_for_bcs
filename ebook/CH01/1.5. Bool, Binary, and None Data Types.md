# Bool, Binary, and None Data Types


## Bool Data Type

Bool variables (short for Boolean) are a special data type that stores the values True or False.
```python
x = True
y = False
```

You can store the result of a comparison in a variable, resulting in it being a bool.
```python
x = 5
y = 0
z = x > y  # this will store True in z, because x is greater than y
z = x == y  # this will store False in z, because x is not equal to y
z = x < y  # this will store False in z, because x is not less than y
```
We haven't covered operators yet (we will in [[1.6. Operators]]), but note the important difference between a single 
equals sign (\=) and a double equals sign (\=\=) in Python. A single equals sign is used to assign the value in the 
variable on the right to a variable on the left, whereas a double equal sign is used to compare values or variables to 
see if they are the same.

Bool variables can also be used the same way we cast (convert) variables to int(), str(), or float().
```python
x = bool("dog")
y = bool(2)
```

When you cast with bool(), it almost always converts a variable to True, except in a small set of exceptions:
- Using bool on a string always results in True unless the string is empty (i.e., x = "")
- Using bool on a number (float, int, or complex) always evaluates to True unless the number is zero
- Using bool on empty collections (lists, sets, dictionaries) results in a False

These statements almost always evaluate to True, as in the examples above, which would then store True in the variables 
x and y. The only time using the bool()

## Binary Data Types

Python has a special set of data types for binary calculations: bytes, bytearray, and memoryview. We are not going to 
cover them in this class, but more information is available here:

## None Data Type

None is a special data type in Python that is used to specify an empty variable. None is not the same as zero, False, 
or an empty string. It can be useful sometimes to initially set a variable to None and then change it later in a 
program. That way, you can have the variable from the beginning for testing purposes and test to see when it gets 
changed. None is also one of the few cases where casting as bool() results in False.
```python
x = None
```
