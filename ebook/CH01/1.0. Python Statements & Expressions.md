# 1.0 Python Statements and Expressions

Python is a language that consists of **statements** and **expressions**.

A **statement** is how we refer to any line of code. Here are some examples.
```Python
print(x)
if x > 10:
x = 5
```

An **expression** is a specific kind of statement that expresses some value. 
```Python
x = 5
y = 'dog'
z = x * y
```
An expression is a kind of statement, but not all statements are expressions. The *print()* command and the *if* 
command, for example, don't express values, so they are statements (they *do* something), but not expressions 
(they don't *express* anything).
