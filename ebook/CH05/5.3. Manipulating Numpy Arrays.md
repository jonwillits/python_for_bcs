# 5.3. Manipulating Numpy Arrays

There are many ways you can manipulate numpy arrays.

## Reshaping Numpy Arrays
You can create a new array (or reference to an array) that converts the existing array to a different shape, using the 
reshape() method.

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])

array2 = array1.reshape(4, 3)  # creates view of array1 that is reshaped from 1x12 to 4x3

array3 = array1.reshape(4, 3).copy()  # creates a copy of to array1 that is reshaped from 1x12 to 4x3
```

For a multidimensional array, the .reshape() method allows you not specify one of the sizes. It will then make it
the size that it needs to be. The way you tell it what size you are not specifying is by using a -1.
```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.ones([4, 3, 5])
array2 = array1.reshape(2, 2, -1)  # creates a view of array1 that has a height=2, a width=2, and a depth=12.
```
The way this works is that you can figure out what total number of dimensions would be (4*3*5=60 in the above example),
and so if you specify two dimensions that give you four elements (2*2 in the above example), then the remaining 
dimension must have 15 elements in it (60/4).

A common operation in many applications is also to take a multidimensional array and to "flatten" it into a single 
dimension. You do this the same way, by using reshape and with -1 as the only argument.

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.ones([4, 3, 5])
array2 = array1.reshape(-1)  # creates a view of array1 that is a 1D array with 60 elements
```

## Combining Arrays

As we said, the size of an arrays cannot be changed after it is created, but you can create new arrays (or new views) of 
arrays that combine other arrays or use only parts of an array. There are many ways to do this.

### Concatenating arrays
```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array2 = np.array([11, 22, 33, 44, 55])
array3 = np.array([111, 222, 333, 444, 555])

array4 = np.concatenate((array1, array2, array3))
# [  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 111, 222, 333, 444, 555])
```
Somewhat annoyingly to remember, np.concatenate() creates a copy, not a view. So in the example above, a change to 
array1 would not make a change to array4.

If you have a multidimensional array, you can specify what axis you want to concatenate along. The axis numbers are 
interpreted from outer-most to inner-most arrays if you think of them as lists within lists.
```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [11, 21, 31, 41, 51]])
array2 = np.array([[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], [-11, -21, -31, -41, -51]])

array3 = np.concatenate((array1, array2), axis=0)
array4 = np.concatenate((array1, array2), axis=1)

print(array3)
print(array4)
```
The resulting output would be:
```text
[[  1   2   3   4   5]
 [ 11  21  31  41  51]
 [ -1  -2  -3  -4  -5]
 [-11 -21 -31 -41 -51]]

[[  1   2   3   4   5  -1  -2  -3  -4  -5]
 [ 11  21  31  41  51 -11 -21 -31 -41 -51]]
```
If you specify the axis=0, that means you are concatenating along the outside dimension (the rows), and if you specify
axis=1, you are concatenating the inside dimension, the columns. Another way to think of this is that the axis you 
specify is the axis whose size is going to stay the same. If you specify axis=0, we keep the row size = 5. If you 
specify axis=1, you keep the column size = 2.

### Stacking arrays

In addition to concatenating, you can stack arrays. Stacking creates a new axis.
```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array2 = np.array([11, 22, 33, 44, 55])
array3 = np.array([111, 222, 333, 444, 555])

array4 = np.stack((array1, array2, array3))
# [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [11, 22, 33, 44, 55], [111, 222, 333, 444, 555]])
```

## Splitting Arrays
There are also many ways you can split arrays. The np.array_split() function takes an array and a number of chunks you 
want to split it into, and gives you a list of two arrays back:
```python
import numpy as np
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
array2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [11, 21, 31, 41]])

array_list = np.array_split(array1, 2)  # [array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]
```
This function doesn't need to divide evenly, if it doesn't the different arrays will be different sizes.
The split function also works with multidimensional arrays, and by default splits along the first axis, but you can
specify a different axis if you want.
