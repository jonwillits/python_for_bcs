Once you have installed  Python, you can use it to run Python scripts. Python scripts are files that end in ".py". Let's make our first python program and try to run it, to test to see that we have installed python correctly. 

To create and run a python script there are two additional pieces of software we have to use:
1. a text editor where we will write the code
2. a "Terminal" application where we will execute the code.

For text editors, you cannot use Microsoft Word or Google Docs, or even most of the more basic text editors that come installed on computers today. This is because they include lines that are invisible to you, but used by the text editor to keep track of formatting, font information, and all sorts of other stuff. So we are going to need to download a program that doesn't have that problem. In addition to this issue, many text editors are made specifically for writing computer programs that have all sorts of features built into them, like syntax highlighting (i.e. turning text different colors depending on whether it is a key word in the programming language) and even automatically detecting and warning you about potential errors. In the next section ([[0.4. Text Editing Software]]) we will describe a few different options for text editors, and their pros and cons, so you can pick the one you want to use. But for now we want to get a basic one to get started. 

A basic (and free) text editor is always a great program to have, even if you decide to use one with more features later. So for this, we are going to start with a program called Sublime Text. You can download Sublime text from https://www.sublimetext.com. Make sure to download and install the correct version for your operating system. Sublime Text is free, though it will occasionally pop up a window asking you if you want to voluntarily pay for the software to support the developers. If you use Sublime Text a lot end up rich, you may want to consider giving back to the people who made this nice program.

Once you have Sublime text installed, open it (by double-clicking on it in your Applications directory or by searching for it in your computer's search function). The first time you open it, you will get a blank text file that looks like this:

![[sublime_text1.png]]

If you haven't already, create a folder where you are going to store your work for this class. I created a folder on my Desktop called "bcog200" (lowercase, no spaces). 

We will talk more about conventions for naming things later, but for now it is important to know a couple of things. Imagine we are writing a program that runs a memory experiment. What should
- for almost everything we will do in Python, everything is case-sensitive (upper vs. lower case), and things like spaces and underscores matter and mean different things. So keep track of which one you use
- you will be typing some of these things (like directory locations) many times, so you want to make choices that facilitate three things (which sometimes conflict)
	- remembering what you name things so you can retype them easily (which means trying to be consistent about things like your use of upper case vs. lower case, and use of spaces, underscores, and other ways of segmenting words)
	- using names that are concise but meaningful: too short and you might not remember it, too long and it is a pain to type
	- making choices that are easy to type (so like, avoiding capitalization and other characters that require the shift key when you can).

Save your text file in the bcog200 folder (by using CTRL-S on Windows or CMD-S on a Mac), and name the file "hello_world.py". Make sure you use all lowercase and put an underscore between the words, and make sure not to forget the .py ending. This is how your computer will know it is a python script.

Once you have saved the file, you will see it appear in the folder. Now go back to the file and type the following line, and save it again.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

A quick note about Sublime Text (and many other text editors), is that they provide a visual cue about whether you have made changes to the file without saving it. In Sublime text, the red circle button in the top left that you would use to close the file will have a little dot in the middle if you haven't saved it, like this:

![[hello_world.png]]

The circle goes away when the file is saved. You will often find that when you try to run a program, it doesn't do what you want because you forgot to save the file. Get in the habit of hitting CTRL-S (or CMD-S on a Mac) frequently to save your work.

Now we are ready to try to run the program. To do so, open your Terminal application. On a Mac this is called "Terminal" and is located in your Utilities directory, which is located in your Applications directory. On Windows it is called "Command Prompt". On both Mac and Windows, you can find it easily by using the search command (just make sure you search for "Terminal" on Mac, and "Command Prompt" on Windows). We are going to use this program so often, I would recommend you put it somewhere easy to access, like adding it to your Dock on your Desktop.

When you have opened the Terminal you should see a window that looks like this on Mac:
![[empty_terminal.png]]

or like this on Windows:
# TODO add screenshot

The terminal program is a text-based way to give commands to your computer. You can do almost all of the same stuff you could do with a mouse, and much more.  In [[0.3. Terminal Crash Course]] we will have a quick terminal tutorial, but for now you just need to know the following. 

Most commands are the same for Mac's Terminal and Window's Command Prompt, but when they are different we will let you know.

When you are using the Terminal, it always assumes you are located in a particular folder, and you need to "move yourself" around to access or run files in different folders. When you first open the terminal, your default location is in your user's home directory (in my case, "/Users/jon/"). You can see this by typing the command "pwd".

![[terminal_pwd.png]]

We need to move to where we saved our file, on our Desktop, inside the bcog200 directory. To change directories you use the "cd" command, followed by a space and the directory you want to move to. You have to type the location relative to your current location. The Desktop folder is inside your user's home directory, which you can see by typing "ls" on Mac and "dir" on Windows, to list all the files and folders in the current directory:
![[terminal_ls.png]]

If you type "cd Desktop", that will move you to the Desktop directory. You will see it worked because the prompt will change from ending with your user directory name to Desktop.
![[terminal_cd.png]]

If you now type "ls" (or "dir" on Windows) it will list all the files and folders on your Desktop. One of them should be the bcog200 folder. If it is, you can now type "cd bcog200" to move into that folder. We also could have typed "cd Desktop/bcog200" to move into that folder all in one command, instead of doing it in two steps. You can move anywhere on your computer in one cd command, as long as you know how to specify the location.

Once you are in the bcog200 directory, if you list the directory contents you should see your python script.
![[terminal_ls2.png]]

Ok, we are finally ready to run the program. Type "python3.11 hello_world.py" into the Terminal, and if python is installed correctly it should print out the text.
