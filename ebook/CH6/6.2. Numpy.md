# 6.2. Numpy

Numpy is short for "Numerical" python, and it is designed to implement vector and matrix algebra in a much faster
and more useful manner. Matrix algebra, from calculating means, to correlations, to complicated neural networks 
and machine learning algorithms, is an important part of modern scientific programming and data science. So
it is great to have a module that makes this easier and run faster in python.

The primary element of numpy is an "array". It's easiest to think of numpy arrays as just an extension of python lists, but with a couple of 
changes:
- when numpy arrays are created, you have to say what size they are and put some data in them (even if it's all 
zeros). You cannot simply "append" a numpy array. Numpy arrays cannot change size.
- the syntax for indexing is a little different, as we will describe
- there are a ton of attributes, functions and methods for doing operations on numpy arrays that don't exist for lists

## Creating numpy arrays

Let's start by showing some ways to create a numpy array. A common way to Create a numpy array looks as though you're 
calling numpy's array function and passing it a list, as in array1 and array2 below.

```python
import numpy as np
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

some_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
array2 = np.array(some_list)
```
Remember that when we import a module, we can use an alias to shorten it, so we don't have to type it out every time 
we use it. That's what we've done with "import numpy as np" above. Now we can use np every time we use a numpy function 
instead of numpy.

You can also create a numpy array of a specific size but full of all ones or all zeros.
```python
import numpy as np

x = np.ones(10)  # creates an array with 10 elements that are all 1
y = np.zeros(100)  # creates an array with 100 elements that are all 0
```

## Creating multidimensional arrays
We can easily create multidimensional arrays in python. To hard-code values when creating a multidimensional array looks 
like it does when having a list of lists. To create 2D arrays of ones or zeros, you just use commas to specify the size
of each dimension.
```python
import numpy as np

# an array with 2 rows and 3 columns per row
two_dim_array1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30]])  

# an array with 4 rows and 3 columns per row
two_dim_array2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30], [4, 5, 6], [40, 50, 60]])

# a 2d array with 4 rows and 3 columns, all containing zeros
two_dim_array3 = np.zeros([4, 3])

# a 3d array with height=2, width=2, and depth=4
three_dim_array1 = np.array([[[1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 30, 40]], [[1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 30, 40]]])

# sometimes it is easier to visualize if you separate it over lines. It is legal to do so if you hit return after commas
three_dim_array2 = np.array([[[1, 2, 3, 4],
                              [10, 20, 30, 40]],
                             [[1, 2, 3, 4],
                              [10, 20, 30, 40]]])

# a 3d array with height=4, width=3, and depth=5, containing zeros in every cell
three_dim_array3 = np.zeros([4, 3, 5])
```

## Getting the dimensions of numpy arrays
When you print or define a numpy array, you can always tell how many dimensions it is by counting how many square 
brackets there are at the very beginning or end. The 2d examples above have 2, and the 3d ones have 3.

But there is an easier way to get the size using code. So far we have used the len() function to get the size of an 
array, but that only works on one dimensional arrays. For multidimensional arrays, you want to access the .shape 
attribute of a numpy array. You can also get the total number of elements using the .size attribute.
```python
import numpy as np

three_dim_array1 = np.array([[[1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 30, 40]], [[1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 30, 40]]])

array_shape = three_dim_array1.shape  # will store the tuple (3, 2, 4) in array_shape
array_size = three_dim_array1.size  # will store the value 24 in array_size, the total number of cells in the array
```

## Indexing numpy arrays
We index a 1d numpy array the same way we do a list:
```python
import numpy as np
array1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
print(array1[2])  # will print the number 20

for i in range(array1.shape[0]):
    print(i, array1[i])
```
The output of the above for loop would be:
```text
0 10
1 20
2 30
3 40
4 50
```

The syntax for indexing multidimensional arrays is slightly different from python lists. Instead of putting brackets 
around every dimension as you would for a list of lists, you just use one set of brackets, and you use commas to 
state what index of each dimension you want to access.
```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.ones([3, 4])

array1[2, 3] = 5
array1[0, 0] = 0

print(array1)
```
The output of the print statement would be:
```text
[[0. 1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1. 5.]]
```

If you only specify one index in a multidimensional array, it will access every element of every other dimension 
along the one that is specified:
```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.ones([3, 4])
array1[2] = 10  # will change every column of the third row to 10
array2 = array1[0] # will create a 1D array consisting of reference to every column of the first row of array1
```

All the other slicing and indexing rules for lists apply to numpy arrays as well, but are adapted in the same way
for multidimensional arrays.
```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 5, 5, 5], [50, 500, 5000, 50000]])

array1[2, -2] = 10  # will change the second to last element of the third row to 10

array2 = array1[:, 2]  # creates a reference to a slice of array1 with every row of column index 3

# creates a reference to a slice of array1, with every row before index 2, and every column before index 1
array3 = array1[:2, 1:] 
print(array3)
```
The output of that print would be
```text
[[2 3 4]
 [5 5 5]]
```

## Copies and References to Numpy Arrays
The last example is an opportunity for an important reminder. Numpy arrays are like python lists, when you assign an 
array to a second variable, or take a slice of an array and assign it to another variable, it does not create a copy. It 
creates a reference pointing to the original array. That means that both variables point to the same data, and so if you 
change one, you change them both. In numpy, these referenced arrays are called "views" of an array. That's a useful way 
to think about it: the other array is allowing you to view the array (or part of the array, or a reshaped version of the 
array), not making a copy of it.

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 5, 5, 5], [50, 500, 5000, 50000]])
array2 = array1[:, 2]  # creates a view of array1, with every row, but only of column index 3

array1[2, 2] = -10
array2[0] = -20

print(array1)
print(array2)
```
The resulting prints of array1 and array2 would be:
```text
[[    1     2   -20     4]
 [    5     5     5     5]
 [   50   500   -10 50000]]

[ -20    5 -10]
```
The location [2,2] in array1 is also location [2] in array2, and the location [0] in array2 is also location [0,2] in 
array2, because both variables are pointing to the same data.

Often this is not what we want. You can use the .copy() method to create a copy instead of a view:
```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 5, 5, 5], [50, 500, 5000, 50000]])
array2 = array1[:, 2].copy()  # creates a view of array1 with every row of column index 3

array1[2, 2] = -10
array2[0] = -20

print(array1)
print(array2)
```
The result now is what we might have wanted:
```text
[[    1     2     3     4]
 [    5     5     5     5]
 [   50   500   -10 50000]]

[ -20    5  5000]
```
