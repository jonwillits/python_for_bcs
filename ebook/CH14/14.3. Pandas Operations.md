# 14.3. Pandas Operations

Now that we have a basic understanding of what a dataframe is, lets review basic operations you can perform on 
DataFrames. These operations will help you manipulate and analyze your data more efficiently.

## Data Aggregation
Once you have selected the data you need, you may want to perform aggregation operations like calculating sums, means, 
or other statistical measures. The pandas module makes it easy to perform these operations on the entire DataFrame or 
specific columns. 

```python
# Calculate the mean of the word frequency column 'LogFreq'
mean_freq = mcdi_df['LogFreq'].mean()
print("Mean word frequency:", mean_freq)

# Calculate the mean of the word frequency column 'LogFreq' for only 'verbs'
verb_mcdi_data = mcdi_df[mcdi_df['Lexical_Class'] == "verbs"]
verbs_mean_freq = verb_mcdi_data['LogFreq'].mean()
print("Total frequency of verbs:", verbs_mean_freq)
```
output:
```text
Mean word frequency: 2.7667932046101535
Total frequency of verbs: 2.8549415738659865
```

Pandas also provides a powerful `groupby` function, which allows you to group your data based on the values in one 
or more columns and perform aggregate functions on each group.
```python
# Group the data by 'Lexical_Class' and calculate the mean of the 'logfreq' column for each group
mean_freq_by_class = mcdi_df.groupby('Lexical_Class')['LogFreq'].mean()
print(mean_freq_by_class)
```
Output:
```text
Lexical_Class
adjectives        2.745108
function_words    3.630915
nouns             2.430455
verbs             2.854942
Name: LogFreq, dtype: float64
```
Note again that, as always, the result is creating a new dataframe object, but with the specified result. Since we 
grouped by lexical class, the values in that column in the original dataframe became the main values of the rows in the 
new dataframe.

You can even chain multiple aggregate functions together using the agg() method:
```python
# Group the data by 'Lexical_Class' and calculate multiple aggregates for the 'logfreq' column
agg_freq_by_class = mcdi_df.groupby('Lexical_Class')['LogFreq'].agg(['count', 'sum', 'mean', 'std'])
print(agg_freq_by_class)
```
output:
```text
                count          sum      mean       std
Lexical_Class
adjectives        810  2223.537441  2.745108  0.518036
function_words   1365  4956.199297  3.630915  0.696591
nouns            3840  9332.946285  2.430455  0.618607
verbs            1470  4196.764114  2.854942  0.667298
```
In this command, instead of just having .mean() on the end like in the previous example, we used .agg() to group a bunch 
of stuff we wanted to calculate for each item, and got the results as a new complex data frame

## Data Transformation
Up to this point we have reviewed ways of selecting specific sections of our dataset by reference and the use of 
conditionals. We have also shown how you can calculate summary statistics. Next we will review instances where we may 
want to change existing data or even create new columns in our dataset using existing information. 

Let's say you wanted to change the name of the columns in our dataset.
```python
# Rename columns using a dictionary
mcdi_df_renamed = mcdi_df.rename(columns={'Word': 'Vocabulary', 'LogFreq': 'Frequency'})
print(mcdi_df_renamed.head())
```
Output (Show renamed columns):
```text
   Age Vocabulary   Lexical_Class     MCDIp  Frequency    ProKWo
0   16          a  function_words  0.035565   4.432119  0.093588
1   17          a  function_words  0.043956   4.466571  0.106888
2   18          a  function_words  0.079186   4.535028  0.171016
3   19          a  function_words  0.103659   4.580457  0.220025
4   20          a  function_words  0.116788   4.635242  0.243169
```
Here, we pass a dictionary to the .rename() method with the original column names as the keys and the new names as
the values. Note that was just a normal python dictionary. You could have defined or created the dictionary in 
a separate line of code, and then referenced it in the "columns=" parameter.

Often, you'll need to create new columns based on existing ones. Say you 
wanted to create a new column called `Days` that creates a new column where the original `Age` column is converted 
to days (here we estimate the child's age based on the average number of days in a month).
```python
mcdi_df['AgeInDays'] = mcdi_df['Age'] * 30.44  # Convert months to days
print(mcdi_df.head())
```
Output (show new column):
```text
   Age Word   Lexical_Class     MCDIp   LogFreq    ProKWo  AgeInDays
0   16    a  function_words  0.035565  4.432119  0.093588     487.04
1   17    a  function_words  0.043956  4.466571  0.106888     517.48
2   18    a  function_words  0.079186  4.535028  0.171016     547.92
3   19    a  function_words  0.103659  4.580457  0.220025     578.36
4   20    a  function_words  0.116788  4.635242  0.243169     608.80
```

Depending on the nature of the dataset and your goals you may need to create additional columns. Here are 
some additional examples:
```python
# Creating a column using basic arithmetic operations
mcdi_df['Frequency_Squared'] = mcdi_df['Frequency'] ** 2

# Creating a new column using string manipulation
mcdi_df['Vocabulary_Upper'] = mcdi_df['Vocabulary'].str.upper()

# Creating a new column by combining two or more columns (outputs: Age_Frequency):
mcdi_df['Age_and_Frequency'] = mcdi_df['Age'].astype(str) + '_' + mcdi_df['Frequency'].astype(str)

# Creating a new column using conditional expressions:
mcdi_df['Dev_Stage'] = mcdi_df['Age'].apply(lambda x: 'Toddler' if x >= 18 else 'Child')
```

## Missing Data
Missing values can cause issues when analyzing data, such as preventing you from calculating various summary 
statistics such as means and standard deviations. In order to prevent issues we want to be able to identify and deal 
with missing data.You might want to drop rows with missing values or replace them with a specific value. 

```python
# Drop rows with missing data
mcdi_df_no_missing = mcdi_df.dropna()
print(mcdi_df_no_missing.head())

# Fill missing data with a specified value (e.g., 0)
mcdi_df_filled = mcdi_df.fillna(0)
print(mcdi_df_filled.head())
```
Here, we use the .dropna() method to remove rows with missing values and the .fillna() method to replace missing 
values with a specified value, such as 0.

## Merging and Joining DataFrames
Suppose you have another DataFrame, "mcdi_additional_df", which contains additional information for each of the 
words in our dataset,such as the word's syllable count and whether it is a common word or not. We can merge these 
two dataframes into one as follows:
```python
merged_df = pd.merge(mcdi_df, mcdi_additional_df, on='Word', how='inner')
print(merged_df.head())
```
In this case, we want to merge mcdi_df and mcdi_additional_df based on the common column Word. This will result in a 
combined DataFrame containing information from both DataFrames for each word. The how parameter specifies the type 
of join:
- 'inner' join only keeps rows with matching indices in both DataFrames
- 'outer' keeps all rows and fills in missing values with NaN.
- 'left' and 'right' joins keep all rows from the left or right DataFrame, respectively, and fill in missing 
values with NaN.
