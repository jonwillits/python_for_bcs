# 3.2. Return Values

Another common property of functions is that they return one or more values. You have encountered a number of these 
functions so far, such as sum() and len(), two built-in functions that take an input (like a list and a sum, 
respectively), and give you back either the sum of the list or the length of the sequence.

The way you make your function return a value is to use a "return" statement.

```python
def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    
    pi = 3.1415
    area = pi * radius**2
    
    return area

the_area = calculate_circle_area(10)  # returns the value 314.15, i.e. 10^2 * 3.1415
```

## Functions that don't return a value

Functions that don't have return statements still technically return a value: None.
```python
def print_the_cube(x):
    y = x**3
    print("The cube of {} is {}".format(x, y))

the_function_result = print_the_cube(4)
print(the_function_result)   # this will print None, since the function doesn't actually return a value
```

The example above is an issue you run into sometimes by mistake. If you have an error that says, "you can't do that
to a NoneType variable", or you print a variable of your own, and it is unexpectedly None, you probably assigned 
the output of a function that doesn't return a value to a variable by mistake. For example:
```python
x = print("Pizza")  # print() doesnt return a value, so None is now stored in x

# the .pack() function doesn't return a value, and so instead of assigning the quit button object to the quit_button
# variable, the line below is assigning the result of the pack() command.
import tkinter as tk
main_window = tk.Tk()
quit_button = tk.Button(main_window, text="Quit", command=main_window.destroy).pack()

# Do this instead:
quit_button = tk.Button(main_window, text="Quit", command=main_window.destroy)
quit_button.pack()
```

## Functions that return multiple values

Functions can return multiple values; you just do them in order the same way you pass variables into a function.

```python
def get_name():
    first_name = input("Please type your first name: ")
    last_name = input("Please type your last name: ")
    return last_name, first_name

last_name, first_name = get_name()
```

The number of variables being returned, and the number of variables being received, need to match up. There is 
one exception to this rule: python will let you convert a set of variables into a tuple:

```python
# this function returns two variables separately
def get_name1():
    first_name = input("Please type your first name: ")
    last_name = input("Please type your last name: ")
    return last_name, first_name

# this function explicitly creates a tuple and then returns the tuple as a single variable
def get_name2():
    first_name = input("Please type your first name: ")
    last_name = input("Please type your last name: ")
    name_tuple = (last_name, first_name)
    return name_tuple

# here, we only have one variable to recieve the output of the function, so python will automatically pack 
# the variables into a tuple
name_tuple = get_name1()
print(name_tuple)  # will output ("lastname", "firstname"), using whatever names you typed

# here everything was explicitly turned into a tuple, so it behaves exactly as you would expect
name_tuple = get_name2()
print(name_tuple)

# here, a tuple was being returned, and you can instead unpack that tuple into separate 
# variables as long as the number matched. 
last_name, first_name = get_name2()
print(first_name, last_name)

# But if you tried to add a third variable here, you would get an error 
last_name, first_name, middle_name = get_name2()
print(first_name, last_name)
```
