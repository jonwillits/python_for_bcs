# 3.6. Lab 3

```python
"""
This lab will be organized a little differently than the others. Instead of having 10 separate questions, there
are 10 things you have to create in a single well-organized program.

1. Create a main function and an "if __name__" statement calling that main function as described in the reading.
Then create a "answer_questions" function that is called from the main functions, and put a print statement in it that,
for now, says "here are my answers". When you run the program you should see that text.

2-5. Inside that function, create print statements answering the following questions:
    2. What is the difference between a local and global variable
    3. What is the difference between an argument and a parameter
    4. What is an optional parameter in a python function, and how do you define one in a function definition?
    5. Run the simulation from book section 4.5. Run the simulation several times, at least 5. Describe what happens 
    to the spread of infection. Then change some of the optional parameters and describe how that changes the result.

6-10. Convert the runner code from last week to a function-based program, within the same code below. In the main 
function you have already created, call different functions for
        6) creating the main window
        7) creating the action_frame and action_canvas
        8) creating the button_frame
        9) moving the runner when the go button is pushed
        10) create one more button that activates some other function that you create and implement, that changes
            the visual display in some way.
In the entirety of this program, this functional version of our runner program, do not use any global variables. All 
variables must be defined within a function (including main()), and passed to the function that needs them.
