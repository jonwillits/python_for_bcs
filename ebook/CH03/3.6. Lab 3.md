# 3.6. Lab 3

```python
"""
This lab will be organized a little differently than the others. Instead of having ten separate questions, there
are ten things you have to create in a single well-organized program.

1. Create a main function and an "if __name__" statement calling that main function as described in the reading.
Then create a "answer_questions" function that is called from the main functions, and put a print statement in it that,
for now, says, "here are my answers". When you run the program, you should see that text.

2-5. Inside that function, create print statements answering the following questions:
    2. What is the difference between a local and global variable
    3. What is the difference between an argument and a parameter
    4. What is an optional parameter in a Python function, and how do you define one in a function definition?
    5. Run the simulation from book section 4.5. Run the simulation several times, at least 5. Describe what happens 
    to the spread of infection. Then change some of the optional parameters and describe how that changes the result.

In the rest of the code we are going to implement a "mad libs" program. For those not familiar, mad libs is a game where
you fill in the blanks in a story with words from specific categories, often as a game with children to create a funny
story. Here is the example we will use:

    Once upon a time, in the vast universe of the human brain, a little neuron named (1. Name), got lost on its way to 
    the (2. Body part). "Dear Axon," it said to its best friend, "I am so embarrassed! I forgot to bring my (3. Object) 
    and now I can't remember the route to the (2. Body part)! I really need to fire my synapses more often!"

6) In the main function, create a "category_list" containing name of the categories in the story above, stored as strings.

7) Create a function called "get_words()" and call that function from the main function. The get_words function should 
be passed the category_list. The function should loop through the list, each time using an input() command to ask the 
user to input a word from that category. It should save the corresponding responses in "response_list", stored as 
strings, and return the list back to the main function.

8) Create a function called "print_story()" that is passed response_list. In the function, it should have the 
story from above stored as a string but with the word RESPONSE followed by a number (corresponding to which response 
should go there) substituted for each category, like this: 

    Once upon a time, in the vast universe of the human brain, a little neuron named RESPONSE1, got lost on its way to 
    the RESPONSE2. "Dear Axon," it said to its best friend, "I am so embarrassed! I forgot to bring my RESPONSE3 
    and now I can't remember the route to the RESPONSE2! I really need to fire my synapses more often!"

The print_story function should fill in each response with the element in the list corresponding to the number. You 
are allowed to hard code these numbers (meaning the code would not work if I added an extra sentence, category, and 
response). But you get 10% extra credit on the assignment for a solution that is not hard-coded, and where the code 
would still work if we added new inputs.
