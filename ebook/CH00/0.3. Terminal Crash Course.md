# 0.3 Terminal Crash Course

As we said, the terminal is a text-based way for you to run apps, manipulate files, and give other commands to your 
computer. All desktop and laptop computers have some kind of terminal installed by default. Most tablets do (except 
iPads, but you can install one).

We've already gone over some of the basics of using the terminal, but here is a quick reference guide for some other 
useful Terminal commands. As before, these commands are the same on both Mac and Windows unless otherwise noted.

I will go over this information in class on Thursday, and a written version of this guide will be available shortly.
