# 0.6 Other Useful Tips

## Creating a Terminal alias to a specific Python installation.

The most explicit command we use to run a python script is "python3.11 file_name.py". Our command includes the python 
version. The main reason for this is that a computer may have multiple versions of Python installed, and this ensures 
that you are running the version you intended.

One thing to know is that on most computers, you can just type "python hello_world.py", omitting the version number 
3.11. This is nice and much faster to type. The problem is that this only works if there is only one version of python 
installed. If there is more than one, the command is ambiguous and so it defaults to whichever was installed first. 
On a Mac, a much older version (2.7) that will not work in this class is the default. If you want, you can set up a 
shortcut to change this default, so that you don't need to type python3.11 every time, and can just type python instead.

### Mac
1. Open a new Terminal window, or navigate back to your user's home directory
2. Type the command "nano .bash_profile". nano is a Terminal-based text editor, and this command opens the hidden 
file named .bash_profile that is in that directory. Macs have many hidden files that don't display in the visual 
operating system, and they all start with a period. This is how the mac knows not to display them. the bash_profile
 file is a file of preferences your Terminal program loads every time it starts.
3. In the window that is now displayed (shown below), type the command "alias python='/usr/local/bin/python3.11'". 
This is setting up a shortcut telling the terminal that every time you type Python, it should run the program located 
in that specific directory (which is where python 3.11 was installed unless you customized its location during 
installation.).

5. Save and exit the nano text editor by typing CTRL-X. This will return you to the regular terminal prompt.
6. Type "source .bash_profile". This basically forces the Terminal to reload that preferences file and notice 
any changes.

And that's it. Now next time when you just type "python program_name.py", it will run python3.11.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

One key to getting faster at programming is getting good at using keyboard shortcuts, instead of needing to click 
around with the mouse a lot. Here are a bunch of examples that you should learn to do:
- saving a file (CTRL/CMD-S), copying (CTRL/CMD-C) and pasting (CTRL-V) text.

Many text editors also have programming-specific keyboard shortcuts.
- One huge time saver is knowing that you can quickly turn multiple lines of code into comments 
(perhaps code that you want to make so it doesn't run at the moment while you are testing something else). 
You can do this in most text editors by highlighting those multiple lines of code, and then typing CTRL/CMD-/ (slash, 
the one on the key with the question mark).
