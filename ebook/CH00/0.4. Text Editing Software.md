# 0.4 Text Editing Software

As we have already described, text editors are the way that you create code for Python and other programming languages. 
Basic text editors like Sublime Text are nice, and an easy way to get started. However, there are more advanced 
programs, sometimes called Integrated Development Environments (or IDEs), that provide a bunch of additional features. 
In this section, we are going to go over some other features of Sublime Text, and then describe some of the 
alternatives.

You don't need to read this section right away if you are happy enough with Sublime Text. But it's here if and when 
you are interested.

This information is coming soon. But it is not relevant right away. Everyone should start with and be comfortable with 
Sublime Text, unless you already know what you are doing. I will go back and cover these editors in a few weeks.
