# 0.5 The Interactive Shell

So far when we have run python programs, you have typed python followed by a file name. You can, however, just type 
python3.11 in the terminal without a file name (or just python if you have set up the shortcut described later), and 
this will open what is referred to as the "interactive shell".

Note that the prompt has changed from something involving your computer name, user name, and path, to just 
three arrows >>>. If you see the three arrows, you know you are in the interactive shell. In the interactive shell, 
you can type and execute python commands one at a time.

The interactive shell can be a very useful and quick way to try out a line or a couple of lines of code, to see 
if it works or to remind yourself how to do something.

When you are ready to exit the interactive shell and return back to the regular Terminal prompt, 
just type "exit()" or CTRL-D.
