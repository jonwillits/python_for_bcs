For Lab 5
- Open your code editor and create a new file. 
- Save the file in your bcog200 directory, and name it "lastname_firstname_lab5.py". 
- Copy the code below and paste the code into your lab3.py file, and save the file.
- Finally, follow the instructions in the code to complete Lab 5.
- Submit your lab using the course website.
- Make sure your code runs without errors or it will get a 0. If you have a particular question you can't fix
    just comment that part of the code out


```python
def q1():
    print("Question 1")
    '''
        Use a print statement inside this function to describe:
        - one way a set is different than a dictionary
        - one way a set is different than a list
        - one way a list is different than a dictionary
    '''
    
def q2():
    print("Question 2")
    '''
        For the following two sets, create a print statement that uses set methods to tell us:
        - how many items are in each set
        - what items are unique to each set
        - what items are in both sets 
    '''
    african_animals = {'lion', 'monkey', 'elephant', 'zebra', 'hippo', 'hyena'}
    asian_animals = {'tiger', 'panda', 'reindeer', 'elephant', 'monkey', 'lion'}
    
def q3():
    print("Question 3")
    '''
    return the sets from the previous function to the main function, and pass them into this function
    then type in a list of tuples, containing at least 4 animals from either africa or asia, i.e. ("animal", "asia")
    then write a loop that iterates over that list of tuples, and adds each animal to the correct set
    print both sets with a label:
        african animals: lion, monkey, elephant, ...
        asian animals: tiger, panda, reindeer, ...
    '''

def q4():
    print("Question 4")
    '''
    Use a print statement to explain why the set created by the code below has the elements that it has, and the 
    order they are in.
    '''
    my_set = set("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")

def q5():
    print("Question 5")
    '''
    Write code that checks to see if 'Champaign' is in the dictionary below, and if not, adds
    its population (88302)
    Then print the dictionary

    Go to the URL: http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.mb.txt, and copy the text of Plato's Republic
    and save it to a file called "platos_republic.text". Then.
    - Q6:
        - create an empty "word_frequency_dict"
        - use python to open the file, read each line, and split it into a list of tokens (space separated strings). 
        - loop through that list of tokens, lower case the token, and remove punctuation from the token
        - check to see if each token is in the word frequency dictionary, if it is not, add it with a frequency of 1,
            if it is, increment its frequency by 1
    - Q7:
        - print the 50 most frequent words in the book, and the frequency of each word, like this (and these are the 
            right numbers for the first 10, but you print 50):
            the 7430
            and 5081
            of 5011
            to 3390

    . Then write code that:
    - Q8: Paste the data from the json example into a file called "animal_data.json", then write code that reads the 
        data into a dictionary called "animal_data_dict"
    - Q9: loop through "animal_weights" dictionary below
        - check to see if the animal is in the animal_data_dict
        - if it is, create a new key in that animal's dictionary called "weight", which points to the corresponding value
    - Q10: loop through the animal_data_dict, and print out each animal's formal name, common name, and weight on each 
        line
