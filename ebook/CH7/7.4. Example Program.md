# 7.4. Example Program

In the following script, I give an example of another Tkinter program, but this time using classes. It solves a lot of 
issues we had before and makes things easier. By making the application window a class, we can make all the elements 
of the GUI members of the class using the "self" keyword. This means that all the variables are now available in any
class functions. So we don't have to pass them around anymore. But they are only defined within the class, so they don't 
cause all the problems that global variables cause.

The program is divided into three classes
1) Simulation - specifies the overall rules of the simulation, and runs it
2) Agent - a base class that specifies the properties that all agents can have
3) Human - a derived class that inherits Agent (and so has all of its properties), plus some of its own
4) ApplicationWindow - displays the simulation


```python
import tkinter as tk

    # a class for the GUI Application window
    
    def __init__(self, the_simulation):
        # init method that takes the simulation as an input
        # declares all the variables that are used in the class so that we can see at glance what is in the class
        # we then call the class methods that create the window and draw the agents onto the canvas
