    In most cases, python is an object-oriented language. What does this mean? Give an example of a way in which
    python is object-oriented. Give an example of a situation where python is not object-oriented, and behaves more
    like a functional programming language.

    What is the difference between a class and a class instance in python? Answer in a print statement in this 
    function.
