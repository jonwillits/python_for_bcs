# Homework 5

### Prepare the project directory
Create a directory called HW5. Put in it a "texts" directory and an "src" directory.

### Download two books from the project gutenberg website using python
Project gutenberg is a website that hosts free ebooks for many classic books. We're going to use it to analyze
and compare two books.

In the src directory, make a python script called "download_novels.py". In that script, insert this code:
```python
import requests
import os

def download_gutenberg_book(book_id):
    # Construct the URL for the book
    url = f"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/{book_id}/{book_id}-0.txt"
    
    # Send a request to the URL
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Get the book title from the response headers

        title = f"book_{book_id}"
        
        
        # Write the book contents to a new file in the directory
        filename = os.path.join("..", "texts", f"{title}.txt")
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(response.content)
        
        print(f"Downloaded {title} ({book_id}) to {filename}.")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to download book {book_id}.")

book_id_list = [98, 105]
for book_id in book_id_list:
    download_gutenberg_book(book_id)
```

Next, go to the Project Gutenberg website and choose two books to add to the book_id_list. Each book on 
project gutenberg has a page like this:
![Frankenstein](../images/frankenstein.png)

Each book has a unique id number. Frankenstein, for example in the image, is EBook-No. 84. Get the numbers and 
add them to your list. Run the script and you should get the two books downloaded into your "tests" directory.

### Do a sentiment analysis of both books.
Next we want to see which of the books is more positive or negative in its sentiment, and how that changes over
the course of the book. Create a script called "analyze_books.py" that:
- splits each book into a list of sentences, saved as spaCy tokenized docs
- create a pandas dataframe that has the following column names:
["book", "sentence_number", "sentence_subject", "subject_is_named_entity", "sentiment_score]
- fill the dataframe with the information:
  - book: the name of each book.
  - sentence number: the number of each sentence in the book
  - sentence subject: the noun(s) that is the sentence subject in the book, using spaCy
  - a boolean telling you if the subject is a named entity, using spaCy
  - sentiment score: the positive/negative score for that sentence, using textblob
  - in your book, using spacy to get the sentence subjects, and
- use only pandas commands to create a dataframe that gives you the mean and standard deviation sentiment 
scores for each 10% of the book (i.e. 10 scores for each book, so a df with 20 rows). it should have the 
columns ["book", "percent", "mean_sentiment", "stdev_sentiment"], as well as an index column
- use matplotlib to plot each set of data as a line plot of the means with the stdev as the error bars. Properly 
label the axes and title of the plot.
- use only pandas command to create a second dataframe that gives you the average and stdev sentiment scores
for the top n most frequent named entity sentence subjects in each book. The df should have the following columns:
["book", "rank", "name", "sentiment"]
- Use that dataframe to make a bar plot with two subfigures (one for each book), with the height of the bars 
being the average sentiment for that name, and the stdev as the error bars. Label the figure, subplots, and axes.
- Your script must have a main function and use subfunctions to do all the stuff described above. No global variables 
or expressions!
