    Load the document "data/ch11/cogsci.txt". Use spacy to make a list of all the sentence subjects in the 
    document.

def q8():
    print("Question 8")
    '''
    Load the document "data/ch11/cogsci.txt". Use spacy to make a list of all the unique entities in the 
    document.

def q9():
    print("Question 9")
    '''
    Create a list of 15 sentences:
        - five that you think are "positive valence"
        - five that you think are "negative
        - five that you think might be tricky to classify
    It goes without saying, please do not use any inappropriate sentences or language that would violate the 
    student code of conduct... 
    Use the textblob module to get the valance scores of those sentences. Print the sentences the results.
    '''

def q10():
    print("Question 10")
    '''
    Load the 16 words in the file located in "data/ch11/words.txt" into a list. Use spacy to word embedding 
    similarities of each of these words with each other word, and save in a numpy matrix. Then use the matrix
    to create a dendogram cluster diagram.
