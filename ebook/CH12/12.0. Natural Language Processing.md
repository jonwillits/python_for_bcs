# 12.0. Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field related to computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics that 
deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It involves programming computers to 
understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both effective and efficient.

There are many goals of NLP and related fields:

One major aim of NLP is to create computer systems that can perform tasks that require human-like language capabilities, 
such as:
  - language translation
  - sentiment analysis
  - text classification
  - speech recognition
  - natural language understanding.

Another major goal of NLP is to process or prepare linguistic data for use in scientific or business analyses.

NLP uses various techniques, including statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models, 
to analyze and process human language. These techniques allow computers to recognize patterns, identify relevant 
information, and generate appropriate responses based on the context and meaning of the language used.

NLP is used in a variety of applications, including search engines, virtual assistants, chatbots, language translation 
tools, and voice recognition systems. It has become increasingly important as the volume of digital data grows and 
the need for automated language processing becomes more critical.

In this chapter we are going to introduce some basic concepts in NLP, and some o python modules and algorithms that
are popular. A lot of the basics of NLP are ways of searching within, formatting, and manipulating text. We will cover 
some of those things in the first two sections. Then we wil turn to some of the more advanced intersections between 
NLP and machine learning in the final three sections.
