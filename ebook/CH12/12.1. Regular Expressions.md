# 12.1. Regular Expressions

One of the building blocks of natural language processing is the development of algorithms for `regular expressions`.
The term "regular expression", sometimes also called regex or regexp, comes from theoretical computer science, and is 
used to define a language family with certain properties.

Regular expressions are a technique to search for strings that match certain conditions. So far in this course we 
have already dealt with some very basic regular expressions, like searching for if a certain character was in a word, or
if a word started with a capital letter or ended in punctuation. But that's just the beginning. Regular expressions 
can be used to search for a much wider range of things. One nice thing about regular expressions is that the syntax
is more or less the same for all popular programming languages like Python, Perl, Java and the C languages.


## Basic regex in Python

When we first introduced sequential data types in python, we talked about the "in" operator:
```python
text = "According to reductionist eliminativists, everything about the mind is reducible to brain function."
result = "brain" in text
print(result)
```
Output:
```text
True
```

Regular expressions are just a much more powerful version of this technique. Regular expressions allow us to use 
`special sequences` and `metacharacters` to perform advanced searches.



### Searching for patterns in text
To start, python has a built-in regular expression module called re.
Once you have imported the "re" module, you can use it to search for patterns in text using the "search()" method. This 
method searches for the first occurrence of a pattern in a string, and returns a "Match" object if it is found. Here's 
an example:

```python
import re
text = "According to reductionist eliminativists, everything about the mind is reducible to brain function."
pattern = "brain"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match)
pattern = "shoe"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match)

if match:
    print(f"Found {pattern}.")
else:
    print(f"Did not find {pattern}.")
```
Output:
```text
<re.Match object; span=(84, 89), match='brain'>
None
```
The re.search(expr,s) function searches a string for an occurrence of a substring that matches the pattern being searched 
for. The first substring (from left) that matches will be returned. We can use the match object in conditional 
statements: If a regular expression matches, we get a match object returned, which is taken as a True value. If no match 
is found, we get `None`, which is taken as False.

### Match multiple Patterns
What if there is more than one occurrence of what you are searching for?
```python
text = "The brain is the most important organ in the body. The brain is responsible for all the body's functions."
pattern = "brain"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)
```
Output:
```text
['brain', 'brain']
```
In this example, the "findall()" method is used to find all occurrences of the pattern "brain" in the string "The brain 
is the most important organ in the body. The brain is responsible for all the body's functions." It returns a list
containing all the matches.

## Metacharacters
Metacharacters are characters you can insert in a regex statement that allow you to search for all kinds of variable 
patterns.


### Search for disjunctive sets using []

You can use [] (braces) in a regex statement to search for a disjunction of set of characters 
inside (i.e. that it must match at least one of the characters in the braces. This is useful if, for example you 
need to search for lowercase or capitalized versions of the same thing.

```python
import re
text = "According to reductionist eliminativists, everything about the mind is reducible to Brain function."
pattern = "[Bb]rain"
match = re.search(pattern, text)  
```
You could similarly use braces to do things like search for any vowel or any number:
```python
pattern = "[aeiou]"
re.search(pattern, text)
pattern = "[01234556789]"
re.search(pattern, text
```
In cases where a set of characters belongs to a defined sequence, you can use a dash with the braces to specify any 
one character in a range.
```python
pattern = "[A-Z]"  # any capital letter
re.search(pattern, text)
pattern = "[0-9]"  # any number
re.search(pattern, text)
```
You can use the carat to negate the search, i.e. to see if the character or characters are not in the string. This 
only works if carat is the first element in the braces. Anywhere else and it actually searches for the carat. You can 
use backslash as an escape character to ignore the normal special function of a metacharacter.
```python
pattern = "[^?]"  # not a question mark
pattern = "[^0-9]"  # not a number
pattern = "[12^3]" # will search for and match the string "12^3"
pattern "[\^123]" # will search for and match the string "^123"
```

### Optional characters using ?
What if we want to search for a pattern but allow it to have optional characters? A common version of this would be 
searching for a singular or plural version of a word. We can use a ? character for this. The ? metacharacter returns 
a match to the string that comes before it, with or without the character that comes right before it. You will sometimes 
see this referred to as matching zero or one occurrence of the previous character.
```python
pattern = "brains?"  # will return a match for "brain" or "brains"
pattern = "colou?r"  # will return a match for "color" or "colour"
```

### Repetitions of characters using *
You can use star to look for repetition of symbols. You will often see this described as matching zero or more 
occurrences of the previous character.
```python
pattern = "3*"  # will match any sequence of 3's: 3, 33, 333, 3333333333
```
It can be used in conjunction with braces. Metacharacters ignore other metacharacters.
```python
pattern = "[0-9][0-9]*"  # matches any sequence of numbers of any length
pattern = "[xy]*"  # “zero or more x’s or y’s”, i.e., xxxx or xyxyxxyxy or yy.
```

### Match at least one of a character using +
You can use the + metacharacter to match one or more of a character.
```python
pattern = "a+"  # will match one or more a's
pattern = "[0-9]+"  # one or more numbers
```

### Match any character (except newline) with .
A very important metacharacter, often called the "wildcard", is the . It can be used to to fill into a any character 
where it is inserted.
```python
pattern = "sp.n"  # matches any string wtih s-p-something-n, like spin, span, spun, spkn
pattern = "brain.*brain"  # matches any string where "brain" appears twice
```

### Anchors
Anchors are metacharacters that check for regular expressions to particular places in a string. Examples of anchors are 
 ˆ and $. The caret ˆ matches a string at the start of a line.
```python
pattern = "^Brains"  # matches the word "brain" at the beginning of the string
```
Note that this makes ^ (caret) have three uses: 1) a match at the start of a line, 2) negation inside of braces, and ) 
just to mean a caret.

### Summary of metacharacters
Above we have covered some but not all the metacharacters. Below is a table summary of the metacharacters we have 
discussed, as well as a few more:

| Metacharacter  | Description                                                   | Example                                                                                 |

| $              | Matches the end of a string	re.findall(r'body\.$'             | 'The brain is the most important organ in the body.') matches 'body.'                   |
| *              | Matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character    | re.findall(r'ba*n', 'banana') matches 'ban' and 'banana'                                |

| {m}            | Matches exactly m occurrences of the previous character       | re.findall(r'ba{2}n', 'banana') matches 'baan'                                          |
| {m,n}          | Matches between m and n occurrences of the previous character | re.findall(r'ba{1,2}n', 'banana') matches 'ban' and 'baan'                              |
| []             | Matches any character inside the brackets                     | re.findall(r'[abc]', 'banana') matches 'a' and 'b'                                      |

## Special Sequences
In addition to the standard metacharacters, there are also special sequences that can look for even more kinds of 
matches.

| Character | Description                                                        | Example   |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| \A        | Matches specified characters at the beginning of a string          | "\ABrain" |
| \b        | Matches characters at the beginning or at the end of a string      | "\ABrain" |
| \B        | Matches specified not characters at the beginning of a string      | "\ABrain" |
| \d        | Matches specified characters at the beginning of a string          | "\ABrain" |
| \D        | Matches strings containing digits                                  | "\ABrain" |
| \s        | Matches strings containing white space                             | "\ABrain" |
| \S        | Matches strings that do not contain white space                    | "\ABrain" |
| \w        | Matches strings containing any word characters (a-Z, 0-9, and  _ ) | "\ABrain" |
| \W        | Matches strings NOT containing any word characters                 | "\ABrain" |
| \Z        | Matches if the specified characters are at the end of the string   | "Brain\Z" |



## Complex Examples

Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, and also incredibly complicated. You can do crazy stuff. Consider this 
example. Consider the following imaginary list of phone numbers. Not all entries contain a phone number, but if a phone 
number exists it is the first part of an entry. Then, separated by a blank, a surname follows, which is followed by 
first names. Surname and first name are separated by a comma. The task is to rewrite this example in the following way:
```python
import re
text_list = ["847-8096 Bieber, Justin",
             "124-7852 West, Kanye",
             "Swift, Taylor",
             "175-1485 Knowles, Beyonce Giselle "]

for i in text_list:
    res = re.search(r"([0-9-]*)\s*([A-Za-z]+),\s+(.*)", i)
    print(res.group(3) + " " + res.group(2) + " " + res.group(1))
```
output:
```text
Justin Bieber 847-8096
Kanye West 124-7852
Taylor Swift
Beyonce Giselle Knowles 175-1485
```
So if you have text in a particular format, you can use very complex regular expressions to match part of it, and then 
reformat it in various ways.

You can use it to do all kinds of validation of data, for example emails, passwords, urls, and social media data:
```python
def validate_email(email):
    regex = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    return bool(re.match(regex, email))
```
This regular expression:
- checks that the email address contains one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus 
signs, or hyphens before the "@"
- that the domain name consists of one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens, followed by a period and two 
or more alphabetical characters.

If the email address matches this pattern, the function returns True, indicating that the email address is valid. 
Otherwise, the function returns False.

Here are some other examples:
```python
def extract_urls(text):
    regex = r"(http|https):\/\/[a-zA-Z0-9-\.]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}(\S*)"
    return re.findall(regex, text)

def validate_password(password):
    regex = r"^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()_+}{\":;\'?\/><.,])(?!.*\s).{8,}$"
    return bool(re.match(regex, password))

def preprocess_tweet(tweet):
    tweet = re.sub(r"http\S+", "", tweet) # Remove URLs
    tweet = re.sub(r"@\S+", "", tweet) # Remove mentions
    tweet = re.sub(r"#\S+", "", tweet) # Remove hashtags
    tweet = re.sub(r"[^\w\s]", "", tweet) # Remove punctuation marks
    return tweet
```
