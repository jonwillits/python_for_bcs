# 11.0. What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a technique related to artificial intelligence and statistics that focuses on the development of 
algorithms and models that enable computers to automatically learn from and make decisions about data without being 
explicitly programmed. In other words, it is the process of training a computer to learn patterns and make predictions 
based on input data. The goal of machine learning is to enable machines to improve their performance at a specific task 
over time as they are exposed to more data. This makes machine learning a powerful tool for a variety of applications 
such as natural language processing, image recognition, and recommendation systems.

Machine learning can be contrasted with what is sometimes called "Symbolic AI" or "Rule based AI" where how to behave is
decided ahead of time according to a set of rules. Consider the example of making an AI for playing chess. In "Rule 
based AI", we might have a system that is programmed using explicit rules for how to behave in a situation. For example,
imagine the following psuedo-code:
```python
def choose_move():
    for game_piece in game_piece_list:
        move_list = get_move_list(game_piece)  # a function that gets the list of all the legal moves for that piece
        best_move_score = 0 
        best_move = None
        for move in move_list:
            move_value = calculate_move_value(move)  # a function that returns a score for how good each move is
            if move_value > best_move_score:
                best_move = (game_piece, move)
                best_move_score = move_value
    return best_move

```
In that code, we might have a lot of built-in information about how good each possible move is (e.g. +10 pts for 
capturing a queen, +5 pts for capturing a rook, -10 pts for putting our queen in danger, etc.).

In contrast to this rule-based approach, the machine learning approach would be to let the machine figure out the best 
move by playing lots of games, observing the actions and consequences, and making decisions based on that. For example, 
a machine learning algorithm might make a move in a particular situation (i.e. with the game board in a particular 
state). The algorithm might keep track of what happens on the next turn, or maybe even for the next 50 turns, and 
"reward" or "punish" its memory of making that move in that situation based on whether there are good or bad 
consequences. The machine learning algorithm could, at the beginning, make random moves. But it would very quickly learn 
which kinds of moves lead to good outcomes and which kinds lead to bad outcomes.

Machine learning is typically divided into three different subdivisions: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, 
and reinforcement learning.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is when a machine learning algorithm is given a dataset consisting of data from two or more 
variables, and trying to learn to predict the value of variables given the value of other variables. One common example 
of supervised learning is `regression`. We have already done a bit of regression, when we were trying to predict
the percentage of children who say a word, given how frequent that word was in child-directed speech. Regression with 
just a couple of variables using simple methods is usually just called "doing statistics", whereas when we are trying to
predict values using many variables using more complex algorithms, that typically gets called "machine learning". The 
boundary is blurry, debated, and not really important.

In supervised learning you will often see a distinction made between `regression` and `classification`. In regression,
we are typically trying to predict a variable with quantitative values. We have already done a bit of this, when we 
were trying to predict what proportion of children say a word with the frequency of that word in child-directed speech.
In contrast, in classification we are trying to predict, binary, categorical, or qualitative values, like whether an 
outcome will be true or false, yes or no, or what category in which some observation belongs. We will talk a bit about 
why the terms regression and classification aren't the best terms in a later section, but it's good to know them since 
you will see them used that way a lot.

The important takeaway with supervised learning is that it is called "supervised" because we know the right answer for 
the data we have (this value of X went with that value of Y, and this other value of X went with this other value of Y)
and we are trying to use that data to develop a model (like a line or more complex curve) that models the relationship
between those variables and that we can use to predict new data. Because we know the right answer for the data we have, 
you will sometimes see supervised learning as being used to learn relationships in "labeled" data, since we know the 
right "label", or output, for every input value we have.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning contrasts with supervised learning in that we don't have "labeled" data or right answers. We just 
have a bunch of variables, and we are attempting to identify relationships or similarities between the data points, or 
to identify clusters or subgroups within the data. There are several types of unsupervised learning algorithms. 
- `Clustering`: Clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on their distance or similarity to one 
another.
- `Dimensionality reduction`: algorithms aim to reduce the number of input variables by identifying the most important 
features of the data. This can be useful for data visualization, as well as for reducing the computational complexity 
of subsequent analyses.
- `Association rule learning`: Association rule learning algorithms identify patterns in data that occur frequently 
together. These algorithms are often used in `market basket analysis` to identify which products are frequently purchased together.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is like the chess example we started with. This is when an algorithm is trying to learn how to do 
something (like play a game), and it gets points for doing well and loses points for doing poorly. The computer learns 
by trying different things and seeing how many points it gets, with the goal of getting as many points as possible over 
time. Reinforcement learning is typically defined in terms of an agent and an environment, where the agent learns to make 
decisions and take actions based on feedback it receives from the environment, with the goal of maximizing its long-term 
reward. Reinforcement learning is commonly used in applications such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous vehicles.

## Scikit-learn
There are many  ways you can do machine learning in python. You can, of course, program algorithms from scratch,
and there are times when that is what you need or want to do. But most of the time, people use modules of pre-coded 
algorithms for machine learning. There are many choices. You can kind of imagine a continuum ranging from approaches 
that give you the most control (but involve you coding a lot yourself) to approaches that do almost everything for you 
but give you little control. If you take a machine learning class in a CS department, you will be way over on the first 
side of that continuum, implimenting algorithms yourself so that you really understand them. In a more applied class, 
you might be over on the other end of the spectrum, where you are just trying to get a basic sense of what some of the 
algorithms can do. That's what we're going to do this week, and for that, the scikit-learn module is a good starting 
option. It doesn't give you a lot of control, and so in practice in science or industry people don't use it so much. 
But it is quick, easy to learn to use, and can give you a sense of what's possible.
