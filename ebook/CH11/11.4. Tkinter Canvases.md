# 11.4. Tkinter Canvases

The canvas is a special kind of widget is a place for graphics. You can draw lines and shapes, load pictures, and write 
text. The only thing to remember about canvas widgets is that you can't put other kinds of widgets inside of them. In 
other words, you can't put a button or a label in a canvas. If you want to add text or an image to a canvas you can, but 
you do it a different way.

```python
import tkinter as tk

main_window = tk.Tk()

canvas_height = 200
canvas_width = 400

main_canvas = tk.Canvas(main_window, 
						width=canvas_width, 
						height=canvas_height,
						bg="black")
main_canvas.pack()

main_canvas.create_rectangle(50, 50, 250, 150, fill="blue")

x = 0
num_lines = 11
x_increment = canvas_width/num_lines

for i in range(num_lines):
	main_canvas.create_line(x, 0, x, 100, fill="green", width=3)
	x += x_increment

main_canvas.create_text(200, 175, text="Hello World!")

main_window.mainloop()
```

A couple of things to note in this code. When we created the canvas, we can specify its height and width. But notice 
that we did this in a variable, then assigned the variable. Why do it this way? Now that number is available if we want 
to use it elsewhere in the application. 

When creating rectangles, you have to specify four numbers. These are the top left and bottom right x,y coordinates of 
the rectangle. We can set the color and border color and all sorts of other properties of shapes like rectangles. There 
are also many other shapes we can make: ovals, circles, and polygons, where you can just specify a list of coordinates 
in order and it will connect the points to make a shape.

Drawing lines is very similar, you specify four points, the starting x,y and the ending x,y, as well as the color and 
width of the line. Note here that we created 11 lines with a loop. Why 11? Well I wanted to divide the canvas into 10 
equal parts using the lines, like the marks on a football field. Here is where having the width saved as a variable 
came in handy. I can figure out how much I need to change the x coordinate of each line by just dividing the width by 
11, and then incrementing the value of x each time through the loop. This is nice because if I change the width of the 
canvas, everything still works exactly as intended.
