def q1():
    print("Question 1")
    '''
        - The reading discussed how you can calculate parameters in a regression algebraically, and also using an 
        optimization technique. Describe how they are different, and what the reading said about what the situations 
        are where you would want to do it one way versus the other. Use a print statement to display your answer.
    '''

    
def q2():
    print("Question 2")
    '''
        - According to the reading, what is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? According to 
        the reading! I know what the top 5 google answers are, and what ChatGPT would say. The reading gives a specific 
        explanation I want you to understand. Answer the question in a print statement.
    '''

def q3():
    print("Question 3")
    '''
        - According to the reading, linear regression bad for predicting certain kinds of data. What are two examples 
        that were given? Answer the question in a print statement.
    '''

def q4():
    print("Question 4")
    '''
        The reading gave code and walked through how to find the slope and intercept using gradient descent 
        optimization. We got this equation:
        y = 3.210 + 1.879x
        
        In a previous section we also showed how to calculate the parameters algebraically. Replicate that code inside
        this function, and see if it provides the same result. Print the equation you get. If it is not quite the same, 
        explain in a print state why this makes sense.

    '''
    take the code I provided to calculate a linear slope and intercept using gradient descent for one predictor 
    variable, and modify it to work with n predictor variables. Then use it on the data below, where each column of x is 
    a different predictor variable, and each row of x is a different observation. When you are done you should print 
    out the regression equation y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3, substituting in your four parameter values for the four b's.
    The right answer will be something like y = -1 + 2x1 - 3x2 + 4x3, but not exactly.

    In data/lab11/, there are two files:
    - animals.csv: a file with two columns, a list of concepts, and a 1 or 0 on whether it is an animal or not
    - feature_matrix.csv: a file with values from an experiment where human subjects were asked to list the 
        features or properties of a each word. Each row is a concept corresponding ot the concepts in the first 
        file (and in the same order). THe columns represent the different features in people listed in the 
        experiment. For example, the first column is "a_musical_instrument". The value of the cell [0,0] is 
        .933, representing that 93.3% of subjects listed that feature for the first concept, accordion. Cell 
        [1,0] has value of 0, representing that zero subjects said "a musical Instrument" for alligator.
        
        You are going to try to classify whether each concept is an animal or not, using the feature vector 
        for each concept. Pick two of the classifier models discussed in the reading, and use it to classify
        the entire dataset. Remember to randomly divide your dataset into a training set and a test set, using 
        80% of the data in the training set, and 20% in the test set. Print which classifier you used, and 
        your accuracy for each classifier.
