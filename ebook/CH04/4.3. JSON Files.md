# 4.3. JSON Files

Dictionaries are very useful, and used all the time, especially once you start embedding other data structures in them.
They can effectively be a database.
```python
animal_dictionary = {'leo': {'common name': 'lion',
                             'genus': 'panthera',
                             'features': ['has a mane', 'lives in groups', 'has bad stamina'],
                             'subspecies': ['leo', 'melanochaita']},
                     'tigris': {'common name': 'tiger',
                                'genus': 'panthera',
                                'features': ['has stripes', 'lives in Asia', 'likes to swim'],
                                'subspecies': ['tigris', 'sondaica']},
                     'pardus': {'common name': 'leopard',
                                'genus': 'panthera',
                                'features': ['has spots', 'likes to climb trees', 'is solitary'],
                                'subspecies': ['pardus', 'fusca', 'melas', 'nimr', 'tulliana', 
                                               'orientalis', 'delacouri', 'kotiya']},
                     'onca': {'common name': 'jaguar',
                              'genus': 'panthera',
                              'features': ['lives in Americas', 'has spots', 'nocturnal'],
                              'subspecies': []},
                     'uncia': {'common name': 'snow leopard',
                                         'genus': 'panthera',
                                         'features': ['is white', 'has spots', 'likes the cold'],
                                         'subspecies': []}
                     }
```
This dictionary has species names as its keys, and its values are themselves dictionaries that all share the same 
keys:
- common name (whose value is a string)
- genus (whose value is a string)
- features (whose values is a list)
- subspecies (whose values is a list).

You can imagine that we might often want to write data that we store in dictionaries to a file, but preserve the same 
format and organization, and then be able to re-import it back into the same dictionary format. Imagine trying to 
write a program that would do this. It would be pretty complicated!

Luckily someone has already done that hard work for us. A special kind of file was developed that is called a JSON file.
JSON is short for "JavaScript Object Notation", because the file format was first developed to be able to solve this 
exact same problem in the JavaScript langauge. But the JSON file format became popular and used more generally, and so 
most popular programming languages have developed a way to read files to that format.

## Creating JSON Files

To make this work, what we really want to do is convert a dictionary (and all its parts) into a string, and then 
write that string to a file. The json module does that first part for us, and then we can just use normal file writing
to create the file.
```python
import json
animal_json_string = json.dumps(animal_dictionary)

animal_file = open("animal_data.json", "w")
animal_file.write(animal_json_string)
```
The json.dumps() function creates a string that includes all the quotes, colons, commas, and brackets (square and 
squiggly) that identify the keys and values of the dictionary, and the kinds of data structures that were stored in 
each one. So when we write the file, we get this:

```json
{"leo": {"common name": "lion", "genus": "panthera", "features": ["has a mane", "lives in groups", "has bad stamina"], 
"subspecies": ["leo", "melanochaita"]}, "tigris": {"common name": "tiger", "genus": "panthera", "features": 
["has stripes", "lives in Asia", "likes to swim"], "subspecies": ["tigris", "sondaica"]}, "pardus": {"common name": 
"leopard", "genus": "panthera", "features": ["has spots", "likes to climb trees", "is solitary"], "subspecies": 
["pardus", "fusca", "melas", "nimr", "tulliana", "orientalis", "delacouri", "kotiya"]}, "onca": {"common name": 
"jaguar", "genus": "panthera", "features": ["lives in Americas", "has spots", "nocturnal"], "subspecies": []}, "uncia": 
{"common name": "snow leopard", "genus": "panthera", "features": ["is white", "has spots", "likes the cold"], 
"subspecies": []}}
```
It's just one big string, with no formatting, no line breaks, other than what you get from automatic text-wrapping. If 
you open a .json file in most code editing software (like sublime text, pycharm, etc.) it will color code it so you 
can still identify the different variables. If you want the file to look nicer and be readable, you can supply an 
additional parameter:
```python
animal_dict_string = json.dumps(animal_dictionary, indent=4)
```
This will result in a file that looks nice and readable (only showing the first portion below):
```json
{
    "leo": {
        "common name": "lion",
        "genus": "panthera",
        "features": [
            "has a mane",
            "lives in groups",
            "has bad stamina"
        ],
        "subspecies": [
            "leo",
            "melanochaita"
        ]
    },
    "tigris": {
        "common name": "tiger",
        "genus": "panthera",
```

## Reading JSON Files

We can easily read in data in this format as well.
```python
import json

with open("animal_data.json") as file_handle:
    animal_json_string = file_handle.read()
animal_dictionary = json.loads(animal_json_string)
```
We read in the file like we normally would, and store it as a string. Don't do any processing on it (strips or splits)!
Then we just use the json.loads() function to convert that string back to a dictionary.
