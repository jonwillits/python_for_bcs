# 4.2 Sequence Tricks

Now that we have covered all of our basic data types in Python, let's talk about a few more tricks.

## Sorting Data Structures

We've already sorted lists. You can use the same trick to sort sets and dictionaries.

Now remember that sets are not ordered, so sorting it converts it into a list.
```python
my_animals = {'dog', 'lion', 'mouse', 'cat'}
sorted_animals = sorted(my_animals)
print(sorted_animals)
# results in ['cat', 'dog', 'lion', 'mouse']
```

It sorts alphabetically, you can sort in reverse by adding a reverse argument.
```python
my_animals = {'dog', 'lion', 'mouse', 'cat'}
sorted_animals = sorted(my_animals, reverse=True)
print(sorted_animals)
# results in ['mouse', 'lion', 'dog', 'cat']
```

You can sort dictionaries too, but it is a little more complicated since it is a key-value pair. But remember that we 
can use the .keys(), .values(), and .items() methods to get lists of the keys, values, or key-value pairs. We can then 
sort them the same way we do lists.

```python
animal_populations = {'dog': 471000000, 'cat': 600000000, 'bee': 2000000000000, 'human': 8000000000}
animals = sorted(animal_populations.keys())
populations = sorted(animal_populations.values())
populations = sorted(animal_populations.items())
```
Remember that .items() creates tuples with the key and then the value, so this will sort the tuples by the key. But if 
we wanted them sorted by the value we can do that too:
```python
animal_populations = {'dog': 471000000, 'cat': 600000000, 'bee': 2000000000000, 'human': 8000000000}
sorted(animal_populations.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])
```
This is another case of using the lambda expression we had to use in the Tkinter button. Basically we can use this 
lambda expression to tell it what index of the tuples that we want to sort by. Using a [1] sorts by the second slot, 
the values from the dictionary. Using [0] would have sorted by the keys.
