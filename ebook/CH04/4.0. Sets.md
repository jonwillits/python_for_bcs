# 4.0 Sets

This week we're introducing two new data structures: sets and dictionaries. Let's start with 
sets, as they are really easy.

A set in Python is just like what you have learned about in math class way back in the day. 
A collection of unique items. So a set is really a lot like a list, except that it cannot 
have duplicates. Sets can be of any data type: int, float, string, boolean, even lists and other sets.

## Creating Sets

To declare an empty set and then add items to it in Python:
```python
my_animals = set()

my_animals.add("dog")
my_animals.add("cat")
my_animals.add("lion")
my_animals.add("giraffe")
my_animals.add("giraffe")  # giraffe was added twice, but because its a set this will be ignored.
```

If you print a set, it prints out inside squiggly brackets:
```python
my_animals = {"dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"}
print(my_animals) 
'''
the above command will generate:
{'cat', 'giraffe', 'lion', 'dog'}
'''
```
You can also create with items in it like you can with a list; just use squiggly brackets instead of square brackets:
```python
my_animals = {"dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"}
print(my_animals)
'''
the above command will generate:
{'cat', 'giraffe', 'lion', 'dog'}
'''
```
Notice that when we print a set, its members are not in the order they were inserted, nor are they are in alphabetical 
order. They are actually in there in an order that makes it super-fast for python to search for them (what is called 
a "hash"). In 5.2 we'll show you how you can sort them if you want.

You can also convert other data structures, like tuples and lists, into sets, thereby removing the duplicates. You do 
this by passing the list into the set definition.
```python
animal_list = ["lion", "lion", "tiger", "dog", "cat"]
animal_set = set(animal_list)
```
Notice that the set definition looks like a function: it has 
parentheses and can be passed an argument. It is a function! If you don't provide it with an argument, it creates an
empty set by default. Otherwise, it creates a set out of whatever you give it.

## Accessing Set Members

Because sets are not officially ordered, you CANNOT access items in a set like a list, with a number:
```python
my_animals = {"dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"}
my_animals[0]  # this would generate an error
```

Instead, the main way to access elements of a set is to set up a for loop with the set as the iterator. You can also
use the if statement to see if an item is in a set.
```python
my_animals = {"dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"}
for item in my_animals:
    print(item)
    
the_animal = "lion"
if the_animal in my_animals:
    print(the_animal)
```

## Set Methods

Sets have a bunch of methods (in addition to .add()), just like lists.
```python
my_animals = set(['dog', 'cat', 'lion', 'giraffe'])
your_animals = {'dog', 'mouse', 'giraffe', 'elephant'}

my_animals.add({'bear', 'dolphin'})  # Adds an element to the set. Note you can add other sets
my_animals.discard('lion')	# Remove the specified item, does nothing if not in set
my_animals.remove('lion')	#  Removes the specified element, or gives error if not in set
my_animals.clear()  # Removes all elements from set
the_copy = my_animals.copy()  # Give you a copy of the set

the_diff = my_animals.difference(your_animals)  # Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
# result would be the set {'cat', 'lion'}, the stuff in the set the method was used for that aren't in the one passed in
the_diff = your_animals.difference(my_animals)
# result would be {'mouse', 'elephant'}

our_animals = my_animals.union(your_animals)	# Return a set containing the union of the two sets
the_intersection = my_animals.intersection(your_animals)  # Returns a set that is the intersection of the two sets
# the result would be the set {'dog', 'lion'}, assuming lion hadn't been removed or my_animals cleared
my_animals.symmetric_difference(your_animals)	# Returns a set with all items not in both sets
# the result would be the set {'cat', 'lion', 'mouse', 'elephant'

is_disjoint = my_animals.isdisjoint(your_animals)	# Returns T/F, whether two sets have an intersection or not
my_animals.issubset(your_animals)	# Returns T/F, whether another set contains this set or not
my_animals.issuperset(your_animals)	#  Returns whether this set contains another set or not
```
