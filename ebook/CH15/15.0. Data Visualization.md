# 15.0. Data Visualization

Matplotlib is a Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. Here we are 
going to use our mcdi dataset to create commonly used plot types including bar, histogram, line and scatter plots. 
To begin make sure to import the matplotlib module as follows.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
Typing matplotlib.pyplot every time is annoying, so it is pretty standard to see people create the plt shortcut.
