# 15.2. Scatter plots and Histograms

## Histograms
Sometimes we want to get a sense of the range of scores or values for a given variable in our dataset. We can do this 
by plotting a histogram. Histograms are a graphical representation of the distribution of individual variables within 
a dataset. They display data in a series of bins or intervals, where the height of each bar represents the number of 
data points that fall into that bin. Histograms help us visualize the underlying frequency distribution of the data 
and can give insights into the data's central tendency, dispersion, and skewness.

For instance, let's plot a histogram of the frequency variable in our MCDI dataset:

```python
# Plot a histogram of word frequency
plt.hist(mcdi_df['LogFreq'], bins=20)
plt.xlabel('Word Frequency')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Histogram of Word Frequency')
plt.show()
```
Output:\
![Frequency Histogram](../images/frequency_histogram.png)

This histogram shows that across all words and ages, word frequencies are normally distributed.

## ScatterPlots
The last graph we want to show is a scatterplot. Scatterplots are useful for visualizing the relationship between 
two numerical variables. They can help us identify trends, correlations, and potential outliers in the data. Here is 
a plot that examines the relationship between a words frequency and its MCDIp score.

```python
mcdi_24_df = mcdi_df.query('Age == 24')

# Create a scatter plot
plt.scatter(mcdi_24_df['LogFreq'], mcdi_24_df['MCDIp'])

# Add labels and a title
plt.xlabel('Word Frequency')
plt.ylabel('MCDIp')
plt.title('MCDIp vs. Log Frequency')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```
Output:\
![Scatterplot 1](../images/scatter1.png)

This graph has 500 different points, since there are 500 different words. It makes it hard to see that there is a 
strong relationship here (remember the correlation was quite high from your homework). But in your homework, we were 
only looking at the 250 or so nouns. This dataaset also has function words, adjectives, and verbs. Maybe the 
relationship will become more apparent if we plot each type of word in a different color?

To do that, first we want to get the unique list of grammatical classes. Then we can create a unique color for each one.
Then we just loop through the lists and add each one to the scatter plot. Each time we make the scatterplot, we can 
specify the color of the dots using the 'c' parameter, and specify the label that will show up in the legend for those 
dots with the 'label' parameter.
```python
class_values = mcdi_24_df['Lexical_Class'].unique()
num_classes = len(class_values)
colors = plt.cm.Set2(np.linspace(0, 1, num_classes))

for i in range(num_classes):
    class_data = mcdi_24_df[mcdi_df['Lexical_Class'] == class_values[i]]
    plt.scatter(class_data['LogFreq'], class_data['MCDIp'], c=colors[i], label=class_values[i])

plt.legend() # Add a legend

# Add labels and a title
plt.xlabel('Log Frequency')
plt.ylabel('MCDIp')
plt.title('MCDIp vs. Log Frequency')

plt.show() # Show the plot
```
Output:\
![Scatterplot 2](../images/scatter2.png)
Now that's a good-looking figure! You can now see a pronounced relationship with each class of words. The more 
frequently children hear specific nouns, the more likely children are to produce those nouns themselves. Ditto for 
verbs, function words, and adjectives. But this only holds within the grammatical categories. Function words like "the"
and "and" are much more frequent than most nouns, but are produced less than nouns, and the same is true for verbs and 
adjectives. This is called "Simpson's Paradox" (not named after Homer...). What looks like no correlation in a big 
dataset becomes one when that dataset is broken down into subgroups.

We can see this in numbers too, by computing the correlations in pandas:
```python
# Compute the correlation across all rows
correlation = mcdi_24_df['MCDIp'].corr(mcdi_24_df['LogFreq'])
print(f"Correlation between MCDIp and LogFreq across words: {correlation:.2f}")

grouped = mcdi_24_df.groupby('Lexical_Class')
for name, group in grouped:
    correlation = group['MCDIp'].corr(group['LogFreq'])
    print(f"Correlation between MCDIp and LogFreq for {name}: {correlation:.2f}")
```
output:
```text
Correlation between MCDIp and LogFreq across all rows: 0.13
Correlation between MCDIp and LogFreq for adjectives: 0.36
Correlation between MCDIp and LogFreq for function_words: 0.40
Correlation between MCDIp and LogFreq for nouns: 0.77
Correlation between MCDIp and LogFreq for verbs: 0.44
```
