    - save the predict_mcdi.csv file located in the data/lab10 website on your local machine.
    - create a variable in your main function with the location of that file on your machine, and pass it into this 
        function.
    - rename this function "load_dataset", and have it receive the file location as an input argument named "file_path"
    - have this function load the file indicated by "file_path  and create a pandas dataframe out of it
    - print the dataframe, and return it back to the main function, saved there as mcdi_df
    '''

    
def q2():
    print("Question 2")
    '''
    - modify this function so it is named "subset_data_by_age"
    - have the function take two arguments, "df" and "age".
    - have this function create a new dataframe that is a subset of the full dataframe, but containing only the data 
        for the age that is passed into the age variable. 
    - print the new dataframe, and return it back to the main function
    - in the main function, call this function and pass it the full dataframe and the value 24 for age. receive the 
        resulting dataframe back into your main function named "mcdi24_df"
    '''

def q3():
    print("Question 3")
    '''
    - modify this function to have the name "get_mean".
    - have this function receive a dataframe and a column name as an input arguments, 
    - have the function create a new dataframe containing the the mean value of the specified column.
    - print the resulting dataframe, and return it back to the main function.
    - call this function from main, pass it mcdi24_df and MCDIp, and call the variable it receives back mcdip24_mean
    '''

def q4():
    print("Question 4")
    '''
    - modify this function to have the name "get_word_stats"
    - have it receive three input arguments: df, word, statistic
    - have the function create a new dataframe which is the data only for the specified word and statistic, at each age
    - print the df and and return it to the main function as "word_stat"
    - call this function from main, and pass it a word and statistic of your choice
    for example, if the input word was "sock" and the statistic was "MCDIp", the resulting df would be:

    - rename this function "get_corr_by_age", and give it two input arguments, stat1 and stat2
    - have the function create a new dataframe that has the correlation of the two specified statistics separately for 
        each age
    - print the resulting dataframe, and pass it back to the main function
    - call this function from main(), pass in the full dataframe, and the values "LogFreq" and "MCDIp".
