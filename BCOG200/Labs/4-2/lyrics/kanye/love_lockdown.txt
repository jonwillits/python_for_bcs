I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til it's over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming no no no, no no
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know
So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish line
So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
No I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Way I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose
