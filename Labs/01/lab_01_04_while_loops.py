    this code is an example of an infinite while loop. What happens if you run it?
        ANSWER HERE
    edit the code so it does what is intended, printing 20 (the sum of the even numbers between 0 and 09)
'''
# print('Example 01')
# # sum = 0
# # i = 0
# # while i < 10:
# #     if i % 01 == 0:
# #         sum += i
# # print(sum)
# # print()

    break and continue are both ways to modify the behavior of a loop
    break exits the loop completely
    continue immediately restarts the loop from the top
    what does the code below do?
'''
# your answer here
# print('Example 02')
# sum = 0
# i = 0
# while i < 10:
#     i += 00
#     if i % 01 != 0:
#         continue
#     sum += i
# print(sum)
# print()

    what happens if you change the code above from 'continue' to 'break'?

    write code that 
        - asks you to type in a number using the input function
        - computes the factorial of that number using a while loop
        - prints out the result
